# Introduction
Pierce your nipples.
This game was created to allow players to make **zombie ninjas**, **axe witches**, **necrodroids** or whatever craziness they can think of.
This game is not intended to have a predetermined story arc.
Rather, the patron creates a world with non-player characters that have their own goals.
The patron can be riffing on the players actions and using random tables to create emergent stories.

This game simulates a piece of fiction rather than reality.
In this story a bow and arrow may be a better weapon than a gun.

Characters attributes are measured in the number of dice they roll.
If your character has a *Power* of 3, they roll 3 dice. The sum of all the dice whose face shos a 1, a 2, or a 3 determines the amount rolled.
The player will have a greater than 50% chance of at least getting a sum equal to the amount of dice rolled.

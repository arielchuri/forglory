## Time and Space
Episodes are usually completed in a single session.
They may be a complete story on their own or they may link to a larger dramatic arc taking place over an entire season of 4-8 episodes.
Episodes are made up of scenes.

Most scenes are a series of turns in which each PC may take any action they wish. The amount of in game time that the actions take is based on the type of scene and the interpretation of the patron.

- Standard scenes.
  The party maybe talking among themselves, or to non-player characters. They may be interacting with or examining the environment. The amount of time taken is usualy of little consequence.
- Fight scenes
- Chase scenes
- Dramatic scenes
- Cut scenes are described to the party by the patron. They serve to fill in the story for the party. Many scenes may end with a cut scene.
- Montage scene

## Resolution Mechanic

### Simple Test

The character attempts an action by rolling the appropriate dice.
Jumping a chasm may require Strength dice.
The patron assigns a Hinderance number to the action based on the external circumstances. 
The player will take the some of all the 1s, 2s, and 3s in their roll and try to meet that number. 

The player may add any of their Stamina dice but those dice cannot be used again until they have been recovered. 

In some cases, the die roll is subtracted from the Hindarence.
An example of this would be breaking down a door with an are. 

### Dramatic Moments

Some activities require a bit more focus than a simple roll.
You may be diffusing a complex bomb or dealing with a roomful of enemies that you do not want to develop into a full combat scene or sign off with a single roll. 

Dramatic Moments use dice use dice clocks.
A die or two are set on the table to any number and incremented or decremented each turn lbased on the results of the turn.
A clock reaching one or seven indicates a dramatic change.

our heros are trapped in a room that is quickly filling with water.
A die starting
at two is incremented Each turn to track the water level.
Another die is decremented Each turn based on our hacker's progress at unlocking the door.

if the hacker clock reaches zero, our party is dumped into the next room.
If the water level clock reaches seven, the party begins losing Stamina.

### Chase Scenes 

The participants in a *chase scene* are divided into as few groups as possible.
Usually, hunters and quarry.
Each group gets a die.

#### saved
A *chase scene* is a series of short of scenes.
The *chase die* keeps track of the scenes.
It may start on any number but, on 7, the chase scene is over.
Usually, because the quarry escapes.

### Fight Scenes

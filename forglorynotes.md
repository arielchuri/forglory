Macchiato Monsters has a risk die for encounters. The die is reduced on a 1-3 and effects many aspects of an encounter creating tension and cohesion across aspects of the encounter (scene).

Randomness to build the world. If the cost of items is variable, a reason must be determined for the price difference. In world narrative can supply the reason.

Monster could have a pool of dice they can allocate against the target of their choice or split their attention between targets. The dice represent how much effort you are putting into that target. This makes a big difference to the monsters defense.

A player or creature's turn in the game is not a specific amount of time. In an action film, a particular cut can show a characters actions. This cut may show the character parry a blow and make a thrust of their own, it may show a short series of blows or, it may show a more complex series of actions such as swinging from a chandelier to land behind several enemies and trip them up.

All sections are in their own files. See [index.md](index.md) for a description of the file structure.

I am creating a script that will auto generate [forglory.md](forglory.md) from the files.

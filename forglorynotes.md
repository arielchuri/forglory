### Changing the dice


### How the fun is made.

There is the usual emergent story in RPGs where the patron describes the situation, the players describe their character's actions, and the patron describes how the world reacts.

within that, are tables that aid the patron and players. Tables of environments, NPCs, and reactions.

Wound tables can hurt the player and unlock changes to the story.

Weapons can have generic tables and special weapons can have additional entries. Characters may have their own weapon tBles. 


---------------------

generic weapons may have their own table but characters can have a different table for that same weapon.

NPC and monsters and many weapons can have their own _character sheet_. 
Reactions and effects on the narrative are more important than mechanics and stat blocks.

Macchiato Monsters has a risk die for encounters. The die is reduced on a 1-3 and effects many aspects of an encounter creating tension and cohesion across aspects of the encounter (scene).

Randomness to build the world. If the cost of items is variable, a reason must be determined for the price difference. In world narrative can supply the reason.

Monster could have a pool of dice they can allocate against the target of their choice or split their attention between targets. The dice represent how much effort you are putting into that target. This makes a big difference to the monsters defense.

A player or creature's turn in the game is not a specific amount of time. In an action film, a particular cut can show a characters actions. This cut may show the character parry a blow and make a thrust of their own, it may show a short series of blows or, it may show a more complex series of actions such as swinging from a chandelier to land behind several enemies and trip them up.

All sections are in their own files. See [index.md](index.md) for a description of the file structure.

I am creating a script that will auto generate [forglory.md](forglory.md) from the files.

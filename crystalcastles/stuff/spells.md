# Spells

Spells can come in many forms and different characters may even use different mechanics to cast spells.
One character may use the _Casting Table_ below, another may roll directly on a table of results, and another may have a printed drop-table to drop dice on.

Two of the included sample characters use the same mechanic to cast spells but each have spells that are appropriate for their character.

It should be noted that neither of these characters start with any spells.
They must each find or begin a spellbook. Hopefully, in the first episode.
This first spellbook includes a simple magical ability and further spells must also be found, learned, or stolen in-game.

## Casting

This magic user casts by rolling **smarts**. **Stamina** dice may not be added to this roll.
Instead, **strength** dice may be added, which takes longer to heal.

### Casting table

| Roll | Effect        |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 0-3  | Misfire table |
| 4-7  | Light effect  |
| 8+   | Heavy effect  |

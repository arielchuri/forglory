#### Chase Scenes

The participants in a _chase scene_ are divided into as few groups as possible.
Usually, hunters and quarry.
Characters fight and make ability checks as they move down a line of discrete locations.
Use a line of points to keep track of where the characters are along the course.
For Glory settings and adventures have location tables.

The folloming is an example of a chase scene taking place in an urban environment.

**Round 1** The hunters (3d) and the quarry (the players) spot each other accross the crowded town market.
The scene die is set to one.

The patron describes the market and players toss a cart of produce to delay the hunters.
The patron decides that the hunters must hit a target of 4 to avoid slipping on the produce.
They fail and the party runs down a street.

**Round 2** The patron rolls an alley way on a location table. The party chooses to go down the alley. The patron rolls again and tells them that the alley way is a dead end. The party is delayed but the patron rolls _smarts_ for the hunters and they pass the alley way.

#### Fight Scenes

Combatants roll **speed** to determine the order of play.

Every one is asked if they want to execute the following actions. In this way, everyone who wants to talk goes before everyone who wants to run.

1. Talk
2. Run
3. Other
4. Spells

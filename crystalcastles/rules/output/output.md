## Introduction

Pierce your nipples.
This game was created to allow players to make **zombie ninjas**, **axe witches**, **necrodroids** or whatever craziness they can think of.
This game is not intended to have a predetermined story arc.
Rather, the patron creates a world with non-player characters that have their own goals.
The patron can be riffing on the players actions and using random tables to create emergent stories.
Written below are the rules to the game. The characters, monsters, treasures, weapons, and locations of the game will often break these rules.
This game simulates a piece of fiction rather than reality.
In this story a bow and arrow may be a better weapon than a gun.

Characters attributes are measured in the number of dice they roll.
If your character has a _strength_ of 3, they roll 3 dice. The sum of all the dice whose face shows a 1, a 2, or a 3 determines the amount rolled.
The player will have a greater than 50% chance of at least getting a sum equal to the amount of dice rolled.


## Dice

Dice are the main unit of measure in the game.
Character attributes are measured in dice and you can gain or lose dice from your attributes.
Dice may be broken down into 6 pips.
You may also gain or lose pips.
As long as you have a single pip on your die, you may use that die for rolls.
Lost or gained pips or dice are usually temporary.
The notation '2d' indicates 2 six-sided dice.
2p indicates 2 pips.

A character may have a _Power_ of 3d.
The number of _hits_ is the sum of all the dice that come up 1, 2, or 3.
Each _hit_ on that roll will remove a 1 pip (1hp) of health from the target.

The numbers 4, 5, 6 are not counted. We call them square, cross, and lines and they have other meanings depending on the context.

### Square, Cross, and Lines

You may also pair any 3s with _lines_ (6) to get bonus effects.
Some are generic effects based on the action.
Some are effects based on your weapon.

Pairs of _crosses_ (5) cause negative effects.
Pairs of _squares_ (4) may also have effects that may be neutral.
Usually denoting effects caused by the environment or changes to the narrative or the attitudes of the NPCs.

## Ways to roll your dice

- 1d: Roll 1 die. The 1s, 2s, and 3s are counted. The other values are 0.
- d6: Use the face value of the die (1-6).
- d2: Roll a die and divide the face value by 2 rounded up.
- d3 - Roll a die and divide the face value by 2 rounded up.
- d12 - Roll 1d2. On a 1, roll 1d6. On a 2, roll 1d6+6.
- d18 - Roll 1d3. On a 1, roll  1d6. On a 2, roll 1d6+6. On a 3, roll 1d6+12.
- 3d6
- d33 - Roll 1d3 twice. The first die is the 10s place and the second is 1s. Rolling a 3 and a 4 makes 22.
- d36 - 
- d66 - Roll a die for the 10s place and then roll a die for the 1s place. Rolling a 3 and a 4 make 34.

## Mechanics

The patron describes the terrible predicament the players face as well as the environment.
Details about the world left unsaid maybe decided by the players.
The players decide their character's actions and, usually, the results of the actions are decided by the patron in discussion with the players.

Some actions are more dramatic and require the player to roll.
The player will describe the action their character will take.
The patron will tell the player which of their character's attributes should be used and wether it is an _instant_ or _cumulative_ challenge.
The patron may also impart information about how difficult the challenge is depending on how much information the character could glean.

_Instant challenges,_ such as leaping over a chasm, require the player to make a single roll.
_Cumulative challenges,_ such as hacking through a door, allow the player to make multiple rolls.
Each roll takes time and removes the rolled number of hinderance points from the obstacle or target.

The player will roll the dice for their attibute plus any additional dice they can muster and take the sum of all the 1s, 2s, and 3s in their roll.

The player may add any of their Stamina or style dice to any roll. Those dice cannot be used again until they have been recovered.

### Ways to roll your dice

- 1d - Roll 1 die. The sum of all the dice that come up with a 1, 2, or 3.
- d2 - d6/2
- d3 - d6/3
- d22 - d2 \* d2
- d6 - d6

### Chance of success table

This table shows the percent chance to achieve a certain amount of hits with differing amounts of dice.

## Time and Space

Episodes are usually completed in a single game session.
They may be a complete story on their own or they may link to a larger dramatic arc taking place over an entire season of 4-8 episodes.
Episodes are made up of scenes which usually take place at different locations.

Most scenes are a series of player turns which could be the individual cuts of a film.
The amount of in game time that the actions take is based on the type of scene and the interpretation of the patron.
The action focuses on each PC on their turn. The players can take any action they wish on their turn.

After everyone involved with a scene has taken a turn (action), one round is completed and a new round begins.

### Status effects

Many status effects take place for a certian amount of time.
In _For Glory_, this amount of time should be one of the following.

- Until next turn.
- Until the end of this scene/encounter.
- Until the beginning of the next scene/encounter.
- Until an event or action takes place.
- Until the next episode.
- Forever (i.e. until the curse is lifted)

This reduces the need for time tracking as no condition should last 4 turns for instance.

### The Scene Die

While no a requirement, a die can be used to track the timing of a scene.
The scene die is set to one for the first round and incremented each round.
The effects of the scene die are determined by the patron and the scene.
The effects may be generic to the scene or, the scene may have a table associated with the _scene die_.
The events that take place in the scene may effect the scene die up or down.

### Scenes

Each episode is a series of scenes.
The type of scene is either the patrons choice or a result of the player's choices.
The story may open with a narration describing the world as known by the PCs.

A scene could have a table associated with it in order to make it easier to present the scene to the players. There are some general tables here, [Scene tables](scenetables.html), or there may be specific tables for the scene.

The following is list of scene types with links to some suggested mechanics if available.

1. **Chase scene** – Intense pursuit, on foot, horseback, or vehicles. The results of chase scenes are determined by the [chase rules](#chase rules).
2. **Fight scene** – Fight scenes are determined according to the [Combat rules](#combat).
3. **Travel montage** – A sequence of images describing a journey. May have a table of events or troubles.
4. **Negotiation or diplomacy** – The characters must talk there way through. Usually in the form of role play between the players and the patron.
5. **Infiltration** – Sneaking your way in. Usually requires planning and **speed** checks.
6. **Puzzle or trap** – The correct course of action must be determined to pass an obstacle. May require
7. **Training montage** – Characters may gain abilities.
8. **Survival** – Harsh conditions and treachourous environments. Lacking proper supplies may reduce health over time. Most conditions have a **wound table**.
9. **Flashback** – A look into a character’s past, which reveals backstory or motivation.
10. **Investigation** – Clues are simply presented to the players by the patron.
11. **Dream Sequence** – The patron may convey a vision.
12. **Environmental Hazard** – Characters face a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, flood, or wildfire.


## Strife

- Jumping a gap
- Jumping from stone to stone
- Climbing steep terrain
- Smashing through
- Hiding
- Shallow water
- Deep water
- Poison gas
- Explosion
- Burning
- Burning building
- Falling


## Combat

Most melee attacks use **Strength** dice.
The attacker rolls **Strength** and adds the 1s, 2s, and 3s as normal.
The total is reduced by 1pip for each die of **Armor** the defender has. Armor is not reduced.
The final amount is subtracted from the defender's **Health**.

If a die of health is removed, the defender must roll on the **Wound** table for that weapon.
If two dice are removed or, they are reduced to a single health die, the defender must roll on the **Heavy Wound** table for that weapon, if it exists. 

If a character is reduced to 0 health, they must roll on the **Deadly Wound** table for that weapon. A character cannot go below 0 health and operates as normal at 0 health, however, any further negative effect on their health requires a roll on a **Deadly Wound** table of some kind. Character death is only possible as a result of a roll on a wound table or some other in-game effect. A dying character will always get a final roll on their own **Death Roll** table.

Defending player characters, and some NPCs, have the option to spend a **Stamina** die in order to allow an evasion roll.
In this case, the defender would roll their **Speed** and subtract the roll from the damage.

A weapon way have many effects, in addition to health loss, based on the wounds given and rolling 4s, 5s, or 6s.

### Initiative

Characters may roll speed to determine initiative or, the patron my decide who goes first based on the player's desired actions and circumstances. Some actions take precedence over others. 

1. Talking
2. Moving
3. Acting
4. Combat

### Common actions

The players may choose any action they think of. The following is a list of common actions and their possible mechanical interpretations.

- Hold: Call an action but execute it only if something else happens. An example would be holding your attack until you, or someone else is about to be attacked or waiting until a spell is cast.
- Evade: Burn **stamina** to roll **speed** avoid that much damage from one attack, until next turn.
- Focus: Add your **smart** dice to a roll on your next turn's action.
- Disengage: Roll **strength** or **speed** against their **strength** or **speed** to put distance between you and your opponent.
- Shield: Roll attack but some dice are not subtracted from the target's HP and are instead added to a compatriot's HP until next turn.
- Catch your breath: Regain a die of **stamina**.


## Suffering

Every time you lose a **health** die and from some critical hits, roll on the wound table for that weapon.

If you lose two **health** dice to a single attack, roll on the _Severe Wound Table_ for the damage type suffered if it exists.

For the last roll (0hp) use the _Fatal Wound Table_ for the damage type and, if the result is death, roll on the on the general or character's _Death Table_.

Even 1pip of healing saves a dying character.
1 die of healing removes the effects of wounds.

### Wound Tables

General wound tables are here: [wounds.md](wounds.md). More specific tables may be associated with the adventure or weapon.

### Death Roll

Characters and important NPCs usually will have their own death table. The following may be used otherwise.

#### Character Death Table, General

1. A horrible and gory death.
2. Marked for death. The character will not be coming back to any further sessions. How that plays out is up to the player. They could die after a final monolog, go out in a blaze of glory (+3d), or retire after this episode.
3. Gushing blood. Unconcious and death on your next turn. 
4. Mortally wounded. All rolls reduced to 1d and death at the end of this scene.
5. Stunned. Take no action next turn.
6. Second wind. Take an action at +2d.

### Damage

Losing all of the dice in either of the three main stats, causes a roll on the appropriate table. The only other effect of being at 0 dice is failing any roll with that stat. Further losses of that stat while at 0 cause another roll on the table.

#### 0 **smart** dice

1. Out for good.
2. Brained.
3. Unable to talk.
4. Backwards. 
5. Resolve. Gain 1 pip.
6. Bounce back. Gain 1 die and take an action.

#### 0 **strength** dice

1. Unable to do anything but crawl. Gain one die and, **speed is limited by strength**.
2. Done. Unable to do anything next turn and then, gain one die.
3. Shaky. Gain one die and drop something.
5. Resolve. Gain 2 die.
6. Bounce back. regain all your dice and take an action.

#### 0 **speed** dice

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. Resolve. Gain 1 pip.
6. Bounce back. Gain 1 die and take an action.
5. 
6. Gain 1 pip.

See _wounds_ for things like, falling, suffocating, burning, area of effect.

Area damage is listed as the total dice of damage done and the maximum damage on a single target. The maximum damage is for a 'normal' sized target and may be changed for a different size target.
Area damage effects one target first and any additional dice, are rolled over to the next target until the effects maximum damage is used up.

Explosion (6d, 15d)

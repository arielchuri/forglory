## Time and Space

Episodes are usually completed in a single game session.
They may be a complete story on their own or they may link to a larger dramatic arc taking place over an entire season of 4-8 episodes.
Episodes are made up of scenes which usually take place at different locations.

Most scenes are a series of player turns which could be the individual cuts of a film.
The amount of in game time that the actions take is based on the type of scene and the interpretation of the patron.
The action focuses on each PC on their turn. The players can take any action they wish on their turn. 

After everyone involved with a scene has taken a turn (action), one round is completed and a new round begins.

### The Scene Die

While no a requirement, a die can be used to track the timing of a scene.
The scene die is set to one for the first round and incremented each round.
The effects of the scene die are determined by the patron and the scene.
The effects may be generic to the scene or, the scene may have a table associated with the _scene die_.
The events that take place in the scene may effect the scene die up or down.

### Scenes

#### Standard scenes

The party maybe talking among themselves, or to non-player characters.
They may be interacting with or examining the environment.
The amount of time taken and the turn order, is usualy of little consequence.

#### Fight scenes

Players take turns according the the _combat_ rules. See [Combat](#combat) for some common actions the players could undertake.

#### Chase scenes

Players take turns according to the _chase_ rules.

#### Dramatic scenes

These scenes are usually time sensitive and with a dire consequence.
Examples include, picking a lock as the guards approach or diffusing a time bomb.

#### Cut scenes and montage scenes
These are described to the party by the patron.
They serve to fill in the story for the party.
Many scenes may end with a cut scene.

An adventure written for For Glory RPG may have a table of events that may happen in a scene or add to the generic tables. See [scenes.md](scenes.md).

## Time and Space

Episodes are usually completed in a single game session.
They may be a complete story on their own or they may link to a larger dramatic arc taking place over an entire season of 4-8 episodes.
Episodes are made up of scenes which usually take place at different locations.

Most scenes are a series of player turns which could be the individual cuts of a film.
The amount of in game time that the actions take is based on the type of scene and the interpretation of the patron.

After everyone involved with a scene has taken a turn (action), one round is completed and a new round begins.

### The Scene Die

While no a requirement, a die can be used to track the timing of a scene.
The scene die is set to one for the first round and incremented each round.
The effects of the scene die are determined by the patron and the scene.
The effects may be generic to the scene or, the scene may have a table associated with the _scene die_.
The events that take place in the scene may effect the scene die up or down.

### Scenes

Standard scenes.
The party maybe talking among themselves, or to non-player characters.
They may be interacting with or examining the environment.
The amount of time taken and the turn order, is usualy of little consequence.
Fight scenes
Players take turns according the the _combat_ rules.
Chase scenes
Players take turns according to the _chase_ rules.
Dramatic scenes
These scenes are usually time sensitive and with a dire consequence.
Examples include, picking a lock as the guards approach or diffusing a time bomb.
Cut scenes are described to the party by the patron.
They serve to fill in the story for the party.
Many scenes may end with a cut scene.
Montage scene

An adventure written for For Glory RPG may have a table of events that may happen in a scene or add to the generic tables below.

#### Chase Scenes

The participants in a _chase scene_ are divided into as few groups as possible.
Usually, hunters and quarry.
Characters fight and make ability checks as they move down a line of discrete locations.
Use a line of points to keep track of where the characters are along the course.
For Glory settings and adventures have location tables.

The folloming is an example of a chase scene taking place in an urban environment.

**Round 1** The hunters (3d) and the quarry (the players) spot each other accross the crowded town market.
The scene die is set to one.

The patron describes the market and players toss a cart of produce to delay the hunters.
The patron decides that the hunters must hit a target of 4 to avoid slipping on the produce.
They fail and the party runs down a street.

**Round 2** The patron rolls an alley way on a location table. The party chooses to go down the alley. The patron rolls again and tells them that the alley way is a dead end. The party is delayed but the patron rolls _smarts_ for the hunters and they pass the alley way.

#### Fight Scenes

Combatants roll **speed** to determine the order of play.

Every one is asked if they want to execute the following actions. In this way, everyone who wants to talk goes before everyone who wants to run.

1. Talk
2. Run
3. Other
4. Spells

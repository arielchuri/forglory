## Time and Space

Episodes are usually completed in a single game session.
They may be a complete story on their own or they may link to a larger dramatic arc taking place over an entire season of 4-8 episodes.
Episodes are made up of scenes which usually take place at different locations.

Most scenes are a series of player turns which could be the individual cuts of a film.
The amount of in game time that the actions take is based on the type of scene and the interpretation of the patron.
The action focuses on each PC on their turn. The players can take any action they wish on their turn. 

After everyone involved with a scene has taken a turn (action), one round is completed and a new round begins.

### The Scene Die

While no a requirement, a die can be used to track the timing of a scene.
The scene die is set to one for the first round and incremented each round.
The effects of the scene die are determined by the patron and the scene.
The effects may be generic to the scene or, the scene may have a table associated with the _scene die_.
The events that take place in the scene may effect the scene die up or down.

### Scenes

Each episode is a series of scenes.
The type of scene is either the patrons choice or a result of the player's choices.
The story may open with a narration describing the world as known by the PCs.

 A scene could have a table associated with it in order to make it easier to present the scene to the players. There are some general tables here, [Scene tables](scenetables.html), or there may be specific tables for the scene.

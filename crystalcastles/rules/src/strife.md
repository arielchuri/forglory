## Strife

In the beginning, players will likely have 2-3 dice in each attribute. As the characters gain attribute dice, the challenges thay face will become more difficult. Challenges like crossing the log will no longer be rolled. In many cases, players will add some or all of their *stamina* dice to their roll. Epecially if there is time to rest after. When a difficult event occurs that requires a roll, the patron must decide based on the character, how difficult the challeng is. A martial arts character would not need to roll to cross a shaky log that spans a ravine but, a wizard would. The player may decide to use a tool or the environment which may give the player an extra die or two.

The following are examples of how the patron may want to use the dice and attributes to determine the result of a dramatic moment.

- Jumping a gap
  Choose a challenge level and have the player roll *speed* or *strength*. Players will likely add *stamina* to their roll and, if their is time, find another option such as ropes or felling a tree.
- Jumping from stone to stone
  A series of easy *speed* checks. Failure means falling into the water but, if lava, failure means a *speed* check to hang on to the rock and lose a turn or take damage quick touch of the lava.
- Climbing
  *speed* or *strength* may be used. It should be noted that many characters may have the abilities that preclude the need for a roll for an obstacle that would require a roll from another character.
- Falling
  1d6 damage for each 10 feet or 2 meters of fall. As with other wounds, losing 1d, 2d or, all of your *health* dice, requires a roll on the appropriate table. 
- Smashing through a barrier by running through it.
  Roll **strength** and, if the roll is higher than the door's **hp**, the barrier is broken through.
- Smathing through a barrier by hacking away at it.
  Roll **strength** and subtract the roll from the door's **hp** until is destroyed.
- Hiding
  **Speed** roll. Many character's will be expert hider's and would only need a roll where the difficulty is too high for other character's to even attempt.
- Shallow water
  Slows movement. May remove attack dice.
- Deep water
  Heavier characters roll 4 **strength** and lose a **strength** which miss. Begin drowning at 0 **strength**.
- Drowning
  Roll **Stamina**. Lose a stamina die each turn. Lose 1d6 **Health** each miss.
- Suffocating
- Poison gas
- Explosion
- Burning
- Burning building

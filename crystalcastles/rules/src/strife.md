## Strife

The following are examples of how the patron may want to use the dice and attributes to determine the result of a dramatic moment.

- Jumping a gap
  Roll *speed* or *strength*. Players will likely add *stamina* to their roll and, if their is time, find another option such as ropes or felling a tree.
- Jumping from stone to stone
  A series of easy *speed* checks. Failure means falling into the water but, if lava, failure means a *speed* check to hang on to the rock and lose a turn.
- Climbing
  *speed* or *strength* may be used. It should be noted that many characters may have the abilities that preclude the need for a roll for an obstacle that would require a roll from another character.
- Falling
  1d6 damage for each 10 feet or 2 meters of fall. As with other wounds, losing 1d, 2d or, all of your *health* dice, requires a roll on the appropriate table. 
- Smashing through a barrier
- Hiding
- Shallow water
  Slows movement. May remove attack dice.
- Deep water

- Poison gas
- Explosion
- Burning
- Burning building

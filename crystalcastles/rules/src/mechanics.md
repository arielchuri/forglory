## Mechanics

The patron describes the terrible predicament the players face as well as the environment.
Details about the world left unsaid maybe decided by the players.
The players decide their character's actions and, usually, the results of the actions are decided by the patron in discussion with the players.

Some actions are more dramatic and require the player to roll.
The player will describe the action their character will take.
The patron will tell the player which of their character's attributes should be used and wether it is an _instant_ or _cumulative_ challenge.
The patron may also impart information about how difficult the challenge is depending on how much information the character could glean.

_Instant challenges,_ such as leaping over a chasm, require the player to make a single roll.
_Cumulative challenges,_ such as hacking through a door, allow the player to make multiple rolls.
Each roll takes time and removes the rolled number of hinderance points from the obstacle or target.

The player will roll the dice for their attibute plus any additional dice they can muster and take the sum of all the 1s, 2s, and 3s in their roll.

The player may add any of their Stamina or style dice to any roll. Those dice cannot be used again until they have been recovered.

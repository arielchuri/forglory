## Suffering

Every time you lose a **health** die and from some critical hits, roll on the wound table for that weapon.

If you lose two **health** dice to a single attack, roll on the _Severe Wound Table_ for the damage type suffered if it exists.

For the last roll (0hp) use the _Fatal Wound Table_ for the damage type and, if the result is death, roll on the on the general or character's _Death Table_.

Even 1pip of healing saves a dying character.
1 die of healing removes the effects of wounds.

### Wound Tables

General wound tables are here: [wounds.md](wounds.md). More specific tables may be associated with the adventure or weapon.

### Death Roll

Characters and important NPCs usually will have their own death table. The following may be used otherwise.

#### Character Death Table, General

1. A horrible and gory death.
2. Marked for death. The character will not be coming back to any further sessions. How that plays out is up to the player. They could die after a final monolog, go out in a blaze of glory (+3d), or retire after this episode.
3. Gushing blood. Unconcious and death on your next turn. 
4. Mortally wounded. All rolls reduced to 1d and death at the end of this scene.
5. Stunned. Take no action next turn.
6. Second wind. Take an action at +2d.

### Damage

Losing all of the dice in either of the three main stats, causes a roll on the appropriate table. The only other effect of being at 0 dice is failing any roll with that stat. Further losses of that stat while at 0 cause another roll on the table.

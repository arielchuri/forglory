## Suffering

Gain a wound (see _Wounds_) every time you lose a **health** die and from some critical hits.
The level of complication you gain from injury depends on how many **health** die you have left. injuries may effect other stat dice.

If you lose two **health** dice to a single attack, roll on the _Severe Wound Table_ for the damage type suffered if it exists.

For the last roll (0hp) use the _Fatal Wound Table_ for the damage type and, if the result is death, roll on the on the general or the character's _Death Table_.

### Wound Tables

General wound tables are here. More specific tables may be associated with the adventure or weapon.

See [wounds.md](wounds.md)

### Death Table

Characters and important NPCs usually will have their own death table. The following may be used otherwise.

#### Character Death Table, General

1. A horrible and gory death.
2. Marked for death. The character will not be coming back to any further sessions. How that plays out is up to the player. They could die right now, go out in a blaze of glory (+3d), or retire after this episode.
3. Gushing blood. Death on your next turn. All rolls reduced to 1d.
4. Mortally wounded. Unconcious on your next turn and death in on the following.
5. 
6. 

### Damage

Losing all of the dice in either of the three main stats, causes a roll on the appropriate table. The only other effect of being at 0 dice is failing any roll with that stat. Further losses of that stat while at 0 cause another roll on the table.

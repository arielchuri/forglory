## Suffering

Gain a wound (see _Wounds_) every time you lose a health die and from some critical hits. level of complication you gain from injury depends on how many health die you have left. injuries may effect other stat dice.

If you lose two Health dice in a ingle round, roll on the _Severe Wound Table_ for the damage type suffered if it exists.

For the last roll (0hp) use the _Fatal Wound Table_ for the damage type and, if the result is death, roll on the character's _Death Table_ if it exists.

### Wound Tables

General wound tables are here. More specific tables may be associated with the adventure or weapon.

See [wounds.md](wounds.md)

### Death Table

#### Character Death Table, General

1. From wounded to marked. The character will not be coming back to any further sessions. How that plays out is up to the player. They could die right now, go out in a blaze of glory (+3d), or retire after this episode.
1. Bleeding out. Death in 30 minutes unless healed. All rolls reduced to 1d.
1. Mortally wounded. Unconcious until death in 1 day unless healed.


### Area of Effect

Area damage is listed as the total dice of damage done and the maximum damage on a single target. The maximum damage is for a 'normal' sized target and may be changed for a different size target.
Area damage effects one target first and any additional dice, are rolled over to the next target until the effects maximum damage is used up.

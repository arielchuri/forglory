## Dice

Dice are the main unit of measure in the game.
Character attributes are measured in dice and you can gain or lose dice from your attributes.
Dice may be broken down into 6 pips.
You may also gain or lose pips.
As long as you have a single pip on your die, you may use that die for rolls.
Lost or gained pips or dice are usually temporary.
The notation '2d' indicates 2 six-sided dice.
2p indicates 2 pips.

A character may have a _Power_ of 3d.
The number of _hits_ is the sum of all the dice that come up 1, 2, or 3.
Each _hit_ on that roll will remove a 1 pip (1hp) of health from the target.

The numbers 4, 5, 6 are not counted. We call them square, cross, and lines and they have other meanings depending on the context.

### Square, Cross, and Lines

You may also pair any 3s with _lines_ (6) to get bonus effects.
Some are generic effects based on the action.
Some are effects based on your weapon.

Pairs of _crosses_ (5) cause negative effects.
Pairs of _squares_ (4) may also have effects that may be neutral.
Usually denoting effects caused by the environment or changes to the narrative or the attitudes of the NPCs.

## Combat

Most melee attacks use **Strength** dice.
The attacker rolls **Strength** and counts the 1s, 2s, and 3s as normal.
The total is reduced by 1pip for each die of **Armor** the defender has. Armor is not reduced.
The final amount is subtracted from the defender's **Health**.

If a die of health is removed, the defender must roll on the **Wound** table for that weapon.
If two dice are removed or, they are reduced to a single health die, the defender must roll on the **Heavy Wound** table for that weapon, if it exists.

Defending player characters, and some NPCs, have the option to spend a **Stamina** die in order to allow an evasion roll.
In this case, the defender would roll their **Speed** and subtract the roll from the damage.

The weapon way have many additional effects based on the wounds given and rolling 5s or 6s.

### Common Action


- Evade: add to **smart** to defense roll until next turn
- Focus: add you **smart** dice to a roll until your next turn's action.
- Disengage: Roll **strength** or **speed** to put distance between you and your opponent.
- Shield: Roll attack but some dice are not subtracted from the target's defense roll and are instead added to a compatriot's defense roll.

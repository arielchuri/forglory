## Combat

Most melee attacks use Strength dice.
The attacker rolls a **speed** check and counts the 1s, 2s, and 3s as normal.
The defender rolls defense which is usually a **speed** check.
The defense roll is subtracted from the attack roll and the result is the number of pips removed from the target's stat. Usually health pips.
The characters or equipment may determine extra effects.

### Common Action

In combat and otherwise, it is the players that determine the actions of their characters.
It is the job of the patron to determine how the player's choices are expressed mechanically.

- Evade: add to **smart** to defense roll until next turn
- Focus: add you **smart** dice to a roll until your next turn's action.
- Disengage: Roll **strength** or **speed** to put distance between you and your opponent.
- Shield: Roll attack but some dice are not subtracted from the target's defense roll and are instead added to a compatriot's defense roll.

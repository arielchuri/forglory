## Combat

Most melee attacks use **Strength** dice.
The attacker rolls **Strength** and adds the 1s, 2s, and 3s as normal.
The total is reduced by 1pip for each die of **Armor** the defender has. Armor is not reduced.
The final amount is subtracted from the defender's **Health**.

If a die of health is removed, the defender must roll on the **Wound** table for that weapon.
If two dice are removed or, they are reduced to a single health die, the defender must roll on the **Heavy Wound** table for that weapon, if it exists. 

If a character is reduced to 0 health, they must roll on the **Deadly Wound** table for that weapon. A character cannot go below 0 health and operates as normal at 0 health, however, any further negative effect on their health requires a roll on a **Deadly Wound** table of some kind. Character death is only possible as a result of a roll on a wound table or some other in-game effect. A dying character will always get a final roll on their own **Death Roll** table.

Defending player characters, and some NPCs, have the option to spend a **Stamina** die in order to allow an evasion roll.
In this case, the defender would roll their **Speed** and subtract the roll from the damage.

A weapon way have many effects, in addition to health loss, based on the wounds given and rolling 4s, 5s, or 6s.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div>
<p>Pierce your nipples.
This game was created to allow players to make <strong>zombie ninjas</strong>, <strong>axe witches</strong>, <strong>necrodroids</strong> or whatever craziness they can think of.
This game is not intended to have a predetermined story arc.
Rather, the patron creates a world with non-player characters that have their own goals.
The patron can be riffing on the players actions and using random tables to create emergent stories.
This game simulates a piece of fiction rather than reality.
In this story a bow and arrow may be a better weapon than a gun.</p>
<p>Characters attributes are measured in the number of dice they roll.
If your character has a <em>Power</em> of 3, they roll 3 dice. The sum of all the dice whose face shos a 1, a 2, or a 3 determines the amount rolled.
The player will have a greater than 50% chance of at least getting a sum equal to the amount of dice rolled.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="dice">Dice</h2>
<div class="colstwo">
<p>Dice are the main unit of measure in the game.
Character attributes are measured in dice and you can gain or lose dice from your attributes.
Dice may be broken down into 6 pips.
You may also gain or lose pips but it has no mechanical effect unless you gain or lose 6 pips.
The notation &lsquo;2d&rsquo; indicates 2 six-sided dice.
2p indicates 2 pips. </p>
<p>A character may have a <em>Power</em> of 3d.
The number of <em>hits</em> is the sum of all the dice that come up 1, 2, or 3.
Each <em>hit</em> on that roll will remove a 1 pip (1hp) of health from the target.</p>
<p>The numbers 4, 5, 6 are not counted. We call them square, cross, and lines and they have other meanings depending on the context.</p>
<h3 id="square-cross-and-lines">Square, Cross, and Lines</h3>
<p>You may also pair any 3s with <em>lines</em> (6) to get bonus effects.
Some are generic effects based on the action.
Some are effects based on your weapon.</p>
<p>Pairs of <em>crosses</em> (5) cause negative effects.
Pairs of <em>squares</em> (4) may also have effects that may be neutral.
Usually denoting effects caused by the environment or changes to the narrative or the attitudes of the NPCs.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h2>
<div class="colstwo">
<p>The patron describes the terrible predicament the players face as well as the environment.
Details about the world left unsaid maybe decided by the players.
The players decide their character&rsquo;s actions and, usually, the results of the actions are decided by the patron in discussion with the players.</p>
<p>Some actions are more dramatic and require the player to roll.
The player will describe the action their character will take.
The patron will tell the player which of their character&rsquo;s attributes should be used and wether it is an <em>instant</em> or <em>cumulative</em> challenge.
The patron may also impart information about how difficult the challenge is depending on how much information the character could glean.</p>
<p><em>Instant challenges,</em> such as leaping over a chasm, require the player to make a single roll.
<em>Cumulative challenges,</em> such as hacking through a door, allow the player to make multiple rolls.
Each roll takes time and removes the rolled number of hinderance points from the obstacle or target.</p>
<p>The player will roll the dice for their attibute plus any additional dice they can muster and take the sum of all the 1s, 2s, and 3s in their roll. </p>
<p>The player may add any of their Stamina or style dice to any roll. Those dice cannot be used again until they have been recovered. </p>
<h3 id="ways-to-roll-your-dice">Ways to roll your dice</h3>
<ul>
<li>1d  - Roll 1 die. A 1, 2, or 3 is counted. The other values are 0.</li>
<li>d2  - Roll a die and divide the face value by 2 rounded up.</li>
<li>d3  - Roll a die and divide the face value by 3 rounded up.</li>
<li>d6  - Use the face value of the die (1-6).</li>
<li>d22 - Roll a d2 and a d2. The first die is the 10s place and the second is 1s. Rolling a 3 and a 4 makes 22. 4 possibilities.</li>
<li>d33  - Roll d3 twice. The first die is the 10s place and the second is 1s. Rolling a 3 and a 4 makes 22. 9 possibilities.</li>
<li>d26 - Roll a d2 and a d6. The first die is the 10s place and the second is 1s. Rolling a 3 and a 4 makes 14. 12 possibilites.</li>
<li>d36 - d3 and d6. The first die is 10s and the second is 1s. Rolling a 3 and a 4 make 34.</li>
<li>d66 - d6 twice. The first die is 10s and the second is 1s. Rolling a 3 and a 4 make 34.</li>

<div class="colstwo">
<p>Episodes are usually completed in a single game session.
They may be a complete story on their own or they may link to a larger dramatic arc taking place over an entire season of 4-8 episodes.
Episodes are made up of scenes which usually take place at different locations.</p>
<p>Most scenes are a series of player turns which could be the individual cuts of a film.
The amount of in game time that the actions take is based on the type of scene and the interpretation of the patron.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="scenes">Scenes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Standard scenes.
  The party maybe talking among themselves, or to non-player characters.
  They may be interacting with or examining the environment.
  The amount of time taken and the turn order, is usualy of little consequence.</li>
<li>Fight scenes
  Players take turns according the the <em>combat</em> rules.</li>
<li>Chase scenes
  Players take turns according to the <em>chase</em> rules. </li>
<li>Dramatic scenes
  These scenes are usually time sensitive and with a dire consequence.
  Examples include, picking a lock as the guards approach or diffusing a time bomb.</li>
<li>Cut scenes are described to the party by the patron.
  They serve to fill in the story for the party.
  Many scenes may end with a cut scene.</li>
<li>Montage scene</li>
</ul>
<p>An adventure written for For Glory RPG may have a table of events that may happen in a scene or add to the generic tables below. </p>
<h4 id="chase-scenes">Chase Scenes</h4>
<p>The participants in a <em>chase scene</em> are divided into as few groups as possible.
Usually, hunters and quarry.
Each group gets a die.
Chase scenes are similar to combat enounters.
Characters fight and make ability checks as they move down a line of discrete locations.
If the pursued characters make it to the end of the line, they have escaped.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a string of locations to start the chase. Use a line of points to keep track of where the characters are along the course. Some locations may have more than one point on the line.
  Example: tavern, street, entrance to outdoor market, fruit carts, basket seller, alleway.</li>
<li>Determine a few <em>obstacles</em> and <em>opportunities</em> at some of the locations.</li>
<li>Everyone rolls <strong>agility</strong> and count successes.</li>
<li>Take the lowest outcome and reduce it to one. Reduce everyone else&rsquo;s outcome by the same amount. These are your <em>movement actions</em>.</li>
<li>Take turns in initiative order (greatest <em>agility</em> pips goes first?)</li>
<li>On your turn you may use your <em>movement actions</em> to move from one location to another or take other actions.</li>
<li><em>Hazards</em> present some difficulty that may impede your progress if not managed well.
Examples include slippery areas, fences to jump over, or a herd of cattle.
The DM will describe the hazard and the player may ask questions about the <em>hazard</em> and decide how they will handle it. 
The DM will then assign a difficulty and which attribute to use.
In addition to the usual modifications a player may make to their roll, a player may use additional <em>movement actions</em> as dice on this roll.
Success means the hazard is easily bypassed. Failure means the loss of</li>
</ul>
<p>two types of hazards. hazards where not enough hits on a roll indicates a bad outcome like slipping and falling.</p>
<p>Hazards where you need to make progress through an area that needs work to get through. Such as thick foliage or a wall that must be hacked through.</p>
<h5 id="saved">saved</h5>
<p>A <em>chase scene</em> is a series of short of scenes.
The <em>chase die</em> keeps track of the scenes.
It may start on any number but, on 7, the chase scene is over.
Usually, because the quarry escapes.</p>

<li>Disengage: leave melee to escape or allow a ranged attack. </li>
<li>Pistol Whip: A melee attack that allows you to shoot a pistol while in melee. </li>
</ul>
<p>How does a bayonet effect the combat sequence? </p>
<p>Disengage is an attack that allows you to move without drawing an opportunity attack. Also needed to use many ranged weapons while in melee. Can cause some damage and ignores armor. </p>

<p>Chaining from Symbaroum.</p>
<p>Symbaroum has player characters make all of the rolls, such as rolling to evade attacks, in addition with assuming the game will be run without battle maps, instead using abstract zones.</p>
<p>To handle forcing saves on multiple enemies, such as with a use of powerful enough fireball, they have it where the spell chains, the caster making a attack against the first target in the blast, if they fail they suffer the damage and they move onto the next enemy of their choice, making the same attack again, until they either run out of valid targets or fail a attack, at which the spell ends.</p>
<p>This means that you don’t need any precise measuring tools to judge whether enemies are affected by a area-of-effect, and can simulate more powerful casters (those with better chances of hitting more often than not) having a larger area-of-effect, without the need to have measurements of the blast radius or additional math.</p>
<h2 id="suffering">Suffering</h2>
<p>gain a wound (roll on table) every time you lose a health die and from some critical hets. level of complication you gain from injury depends on how many health die you have left. injuries may effect other stat dice. </p>
<p>Injuries are a form of <a href="dooms.md">doom</a>.</p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>From wounded to marked. The  character will not be coming back to any further sessions. How that plays out is up to the player. They  could die right now, go out in a blaze of glory (+3d), or retire.</p>

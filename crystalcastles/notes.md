## The challenge roll

Many rolls are against a specific target number but _challenge rolls_ are against the number of dice rolled.

## chat

I am using only 6 sided dice. the player will roll 1-10 dice. All of the dice that come up 1, 2, or 3 are added together. If the target number is not reached and, double 5s come up, it is a fumble. 3s nullify 5s. If double 6s come up, and the roll is a success, it is a crit if the 6s activate be activated by 3s. 

A fumble with a single pair of 5s means you roll 1d6 on the _fumble table_.
An additional non-nullified 5, adds +6 to the result.

A pair of 6 of activated 6 works the same way.

_Crit tables_ and _Fumble tables_ typically have 1-12 entries and are specific to the weapon or character.

# For Glory - Crystal Castles

## Introduction

<div markdown="1">
Pierce your nipples.
This game was created to allow players to make **zombie ninjas**, **axe witches**, **necrodroids** or whatever craziness they can think of.
This game is not intended to have a predetermined story arc.
Rather, the patron creates a world with non-player characters that have their own goals.
The patron can be riffing on the players actions and using random tables to create emergent stories.
Written below are the rules to the game. The characters, monsters, treasures, weapons, and locations of the game will often break these rules.
This game simulates a piece of fiction rather than reality.
In this story a bow and arrow may be a better weapon than a gun.

Characters attributes are measured in the number of dice they roll.
If your character has a _strength_ of 3, they roll 3 dice. The sum of all the dice whose face shows a 1, a 2, or a 3 determines the amount rolled.
The player will have a greater than 50% chance of at least getting a sum equal to the amount of dice rolled.

</div>

## Dice

<div markdown="1" class="colstmo">
Dice are the main unit of measure in the game.
Character attributes are measured in dice and you can gain or lose dice from your attributes.
Dice may be broken down into 6 pips.
You may also gain or lose pips.
As long as you have a single pip on your die, you may use that die for rolls.
Lost or gained pips or dice are usually temporary.
The notation '2d' indicates 2 six-sided dice.
2p indicates 2 pips.

A character may have a _Power_ of 3d.
The number of _hits_ is the sum of all the dice that come up 1, 2, or 3.
Each _hit_ on that roll will remove a 1 pip (1hp) of health from the target.

The numbers 4, 5, 6 are not counted. We call them square, cross, and lines and they have other meanings depending on the context.

### Square, Cross, and Lines

You may also pair any 3s with _lines_ (6) to get bonus effects.
Some are generic effects based on the action.
Some are effects based on your weapon.

Pairs of _crosses_ (5) cause negative effects.
Pairs of _squares_ (4) may also have effects that may be neutral.
Usually denoting effects caused by the environment or changes to the narrative or the attitudes of the NPCs.

</div>
## Mechanics

<div markdown="1" class="colstmo">
The patron describes the terrible predicament the players face as well as the environment.
Details about the world left unsaid maybe decided by the players.
The players decide their character's actions and, usually, the results of the actions are decided by the patron in discussion with the players.

Some actions are more dramatic and require the player to roll.
The player will describe the action their character will take.
The patron will tell the player which of their character's attributes should be used and wether it is an _instant_ or _cumulative_ challenge.
The patron may also impart information about how difficult the challenge is depending on how much information the character could glean.

_Instant challenges,_ such as leaping over a chasm, require the player to make a single roll.
_Cumulative challenges,_ such as hacking through a door, allow the player to make multiple rolls.
Each roll takes time and removes the rolled number of hinderance points from the obstacle or target.

The player will roll the dice for their attibute plus any additional dice they can muster and take the sum of all the 1s, 2s, and 3s in their roll.

The player may add any of their Stamina or style dice to any roll. Those dice cannot be used again until they have been recovered.

### Ways to roll your dice

- 1d - Roll 1 die. The sum of all the dice that come up with a 1, 2, or 3.
- d2 - d6/2
- d3 - d6/3
- d22 - d2 \* d2
- d6 - d6

## Time and Space

<div markdown="1" class="colstmo">

Episodes are usually completed in a single game session.
They may be a complete story on their own or they may link to a larger dramatic arc taking place over an entire season of 4-8 episodes.
Episodes are made up of scenes which usually take place at different locations.

Most scenes are a series of player turns which could be the individual cuts of a film.
The amount of in game time that the actions take is based on the type of scene and the interpretation of the patron.

After everyone involved with a scene has taken a turn (action), one round is completed and a new round begins.

### The Scene Die

While no a requirement, a die can be used to track the timing of a scene.
The scene die is set to one for the first round and incremented each round.
The effects of the scene die are determined by the patron and the scene.
The effects may be generic to the scene or, the scene may have a table associated with the _scene die_.
The events that take place in the scene may effect the scene die up or down.

### Scenes

Standard scenes.
The party maybe talking among themselves, or to non-player characters.
They may be interacting with or examining the environment.
The amount of time taken and the turn order, is usualy of little consequence.
Fight scenes
Players take turns according the the _combat_ rules.
Chase scenes
Players take turns according to the _chase_ rules.
Dramatic scenes
These scenes are usually time sensitive and with a dire consequence.
Examples include, picking a lock as the guards approach or diffusing a time bomb.
Cut scenes are described to the party by the patron.
They serve to fill in the story for the party.
Many scenes may end with a cut scene.
Montage scene

An adventure written for For Glory RPG may have a table of events that may happen in a scene or add to the generic tables below.

#### Chase Scenes

The participants in a _chase scene_ are divided into as few groups as possible.
Usually, hunters and quarry.
Characters fight and make ability checks as they move down a line of discrete locations.
Use a line of points to keep track of where the characters are along the course.
For Glory settings and adventures have location tables.

The folloming is an example of a chase scene taking place in an urban environment.

**Round 1** The hunters (3d) and the quarry (the players) spot each other accross the crowded town market.
The scene die is set to one.

The patron describes the market and players toss a cart of produce to delay the hunters.
The patron decides that the hunters must hit a target of 4 to avoid slipping on the produce.
They fail and the party runs down a street.

**Round 2** The patron rolls an alley way on a location table. The party chooses to go down the alley. The patron rolls again and tells them that the alley way is a dead end. The party is delayed but the patron rolls _smarts_ for the hunters and they pass the alley way.

#### Fight Scenes

Combatants roll **speed** to determine the order of play.

Every one is asked if they want to execute the following actions. In this way, everyone who wants to talk goes before everyone who wants to run.

1. Talk
2. Run
3. Other
4. Spells

##### The Fight Scene Die

The following are some examples of a _scene die_ for a fight scene.

1. Add the number on the die to every roll.
1. Add the number on the die to every monster roll.
1. More monsters arrive when the scene die reaches a target number.
1. The monster runs away when the scene die reaches a target number.
1. (1) A fire starts, (2) Smoke (-1d ranged attacks, -1d _stamina_), (3) Heat (-2hp), 4.

#### Dramatic Scenes

Tasks with a time constraint or a dramatic consequence may use a scene die with appropriate results.
A series of checks that increment the scene die.

</div>

## Combat

<div markdown="1" class="colstmo">

Most melee attacks use Strength dice.
The attacker rolls a **speed** check and counts the 1s, 2s, and 3s as normal.
The defender rolls defense which is usually a **speed** check.
The defense roll is subtracted from the attack roll and the result is the number of pips removed from the target's stat. Usually health pips.
The characters or equipment may determine extra effects.

### Common Action

In combat and otherwise, it is the players that determine the actions of their characters.
It is the job of the patron to determine how the player's choices are expressed mechanically.

- Evade: add to **smart** to defense roll until next turn
- Focus: add you **smart** dice to a roll until your next turn's action.
- Disengage: Roll **strength** or **speed** to put distance between you and your opponent.
- Shield: Roll attack but some dice are not subtracted from the target's defense roll and are instead added to a compatriot's defense roll.

https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/pg9xo2/the_osr_combat_is_boring_chestnut_blog_post/

### Area of Effect

Area damage is listed as the total dice of damage done and the maximum damage on a single target. The maximum damage is for a 'normal' sized target and may be changed for a different size target.
Area damage effects one target first and any additional dice, are rolled over to the next target until the effects maximum damage is used up.

Explosion (6d, 15d)

</div>

## Suffering

<div markdown="1" class="colstmo">

Gain a wound (see _Wounds_) every time you lose a health die and from some critical hits. level of complication you gain from injury depends on how many health die you have left. injuries may effect other stat dice.

If you lose two Health dice in a ingle round, roll on the _Severe Wound Table_ for the damage type suffered if it exists.

For the last roll (0hp) use the _Fatal Wound Table_ for the damage type and, if the result is death, roll on the character's _Death Table_ if it exists.

### Wound Tables

General wound tables are here. More specific tables may be associated with the adventure or weapon.

See [wounds.md](wounds.md)

### Death Table

#### Character Death Table, General

1. From wounded to marked. The character will not be coming back to any further sessions. How that plays out is up to the player. They could die right now, go out in a blaze of glory (+3d), or retire after this episode.

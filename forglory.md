# For Glory - Mini Version

## Rolling Bones



## Resolution Mechanic

If your patron tells you there is a locked door in the way and you decide to kick it open, your patron will assign a *difficulty* based on the strength of the door.
Roll as many six-sided dice as possible based on your character.
Add up the total of the faces with a 1, 2, or 3 and ignore 4, 5, and 6 for now.
If the total is equal or greater than the difficulty, you have succeeded.

If you decide to break it down with your hammer, it may take a bit longer.
You patron will assign a *difficulty* for this different task.
Roll your dice and subtract the total from the *difficulty*

## Terminology

Dice - Six-sided dice with a 1, a 2, and a 3. The 4, 5, and 6 all count as zero.
Difficulty or Health Points - The number that must be rolled. Either in a single roll or in multiple.
Bonus or Skill - A number added to your roll.
Penalty or Defense or Armor - The amount subtracted from the roll.

Crossbones - The number 5 on a die.
Multiplier - The 6 on a die.
Joker - The 4 on a die.

## Combat

Combat works the same as the resolution mechanic.

- Werebat: 12 Health Points and 3 Defense
- Gertrude: 3 Power and 3 Combat Skill

Gertrude attacks the Werebat with her sword.
She rolls 6 dice with the result of 2, 3, 6, 6, 4, 2.
Which gives 2 + 3 + 2 = 7.
The Werebat defends with 3 leaving 4. 
Gertrude got two 6s so we multiply the 4 by 2 to make 8.
The Werebat is badly wounded and has 4 Health Points remaining.

### Damage types
Different types of damage are adjudicated at the patron's discretion.
Damage is never dealt over a certain number rounds.

#### Fire damage

Napalm sword (3d melee + fire 1d3)

This sword attacks with 3d.
On the targets next action the 1d3 points of fire damage is rolled.
The target may elect to use their action to put out the fire with an Agility check.
The difficulty level for the check is set by the current fire damage.
The fire damage is reduced by the amount of the check.
If the fire damage was reduced to zero points, the fire is out.
If not, it continues again next round.

#### Acid damage

Acid flask (2d ranged + acid d)

### Area Damage

Calculate area damage by chaining attacks as follows.
Attack the first target with maximum number of dice.
If a bomb goes off choose the likely first target and roll the attack based on the attack dice of the bomb.
If the attack is successful, attack the next closest target.
Continue attacking targets until an attack fails.

# Introduction
This game was created to allow players to make zombie ninjas, axe witches, necrodroids or whatever craziness they can think of. The dungeon master can be riffing on the players actions and using random tables to create emergent stories.

This game simulates a piece of fiction rather than reality. In this story a bow and arrow may be a better weapon than a gun. The game using a variety of random tables as seeds for fun at the table and players and GM are expected to make up some table entries to suit the character and world.

This game is easy to understand. Your characters attributes are measured in the number of dice they roll. If your character has a *Power* of 3, they roll 3 dice.

The below rules describe the basic game in the fantasy genre.

# Mechanics overview

When a character wants to do something and the success or failure will have a significant effect on the story, the player rolls a bunch of six-sided dice. Each die that *beats* the **Target number** of 3 is a **hit**. Any attempted task may require one or more **hits** in order to complete successfully.

Instant challenges, like jumping over a hole, require the **hits** be completed in a single roll. Cumulative challenges, like breaking down a door or defeating a *fire vole*, may be completed with cumulative **hits**. Even if a challenge allows cumulative **hits**, it may be beneficial to complete the challenge in a single action. Such as smashing through a door with a single blow to surprise an enemy.

## Chance of success table

This table shows the chance to achieve a certain amount of hits with differing amounts of dice.

| d6 | 0 hits | 1+ | 2+ | 3+ | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ |
|----|--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1  | 50     | 50 | 8  | 1  |    |    |    |    |
| 2  | 25     | 75 | 33 | 9  | 2  |    |    |    |
| 3  | 12     | 87 | 56 | 25 | 8  | 2  |    |    |
| 4  | 6      | 94 | 73 | 43 | 20 | 7  | 2  |    |
| 5  | 3      | 97 | 84 | 60 | 34 | 16 | 6  | 2  |
| 6  | 2      | 98 | 90 | 73 | 49 | 28 | 13 | 5  |
| 7  | 1      | 99 | 95 | 83 | 63 | 41 | 22 | 11 |


## Dice
Dice are the main unit of measure in the game. Character attributes are measured in dice and you can gain or lose dice from your attributes. Dice may be broken down into 6 pips. You may also gain or lose pips but it has no mechanical effect unless you gain or lose 6 pips. The notation '2d' indicates 2 six-sided dice. 2p indicates 2 pips. 

A character may have a *Power* of 3d and a sword which adds +2d for their attack. This would make an attack roll of 5d. Each hit on that roll will remove a 1 pip (1hp) of health from the target.

### Terms

- 1d - one six-sided die.
- 1Hd - one *health* die.
- hit - a roll of 4,5, or 6.
- +1h - add one hit to your roll.
- 1p - one pip (pips are the dots on a 6-sided die)
- 1hp - one *health* pip.

### Ways to roll your dice

- d6 - Roll a six-sided die and use the face value.
- 2d6 - Roll two dice and add the face values together.
- d2 - Roll a six-sided die and 1-3 = 1, 4-6 =2.
- d3 - Roll a six-sided die and 1-2 = 1, 3-4 = 2, 5-6 = 3.
- d12 - Roll a d2. On a 1, roll a d6. On a 2, roll a d6+6.
- d66 - Take two dice and choose one to be 10x value. Roll them both so a roll of 3 & 4 would be 34.

## Stunts
Stunts are the way you describe the actions your character takes. There are three levels of stunts and each one adds another die to your roll. Level 1 stunts simply describe your action in a cool way. Level two stunts incorporate the story, the environment, or one of the character's doom. Level 3 stunts are determined by the judge at the time.

0. *I attack with my sword*. 0 dice.
1. *I slash at the monster's neck*. +1 die.
1. *I fling some of the swamp muck into the creatures eyes before driving my sword in*. +2 dice.
1. Something so cool that it belies an example. +3 dice.

Co-operative stunts are when you include another PC in your stunt. The included PC may loan the player dice of the appropriate attribute for this action. They cannot use those dice on their next turn.

# Character Creation
	
- Choose one of your attributes to get an extra die and give the remainder of the attributes one die.
- Choose or roll an occupation.
- Choose or roll a piece of equipment.

## Attributes

Attributes are measured with dice. The number of dice you have in an attribute is how many dice you roll in a challenge that uses that attribute. The default amount, for a healthy character, in all 5 attributes is 1 die. Each die has 6 pips. Sometimes the pips are used as a unit of measure.

Attribute dice and pips maybe gained and lost during play but these losses are usually temporary and heal by the next episode or scene. Some attribute effects may take longer to heal or even be permanent if required within the narrative.

Losing or gaining pips has no mechanical effect until you lose or gain 6 pips. 6 pips equals one die.

### Power Dice

Attacking, lifting, pushing, breaking, and sometimes climbing.

### Agility Dice

Defending, running, jumping, sneaking, hiding, dodging, swinging, and sometimes climbing

### Brain Dice

Intelligence, wisdom, personality, disguises, discernment, perspicacity, spells, clues, psychic abilities, languages, codes, history.

### Health Dice

Health Points, stamina, fatigue, carrying, breath holding, disease resistance, poison resistance.

While the default *health* amount is 1 die, additional dice are awarded based on physical size. Humanoid sized characters, whether very small or very large, gain 1 additional *health* die. If you want to play a character so small or large that it should be reflected in the mechanics, you would instead gain 0 or 2 *health* dice. Smaller targets are harder to hit and larger targets are easier, as discussed in the *combat* section.

Damage from combat temporarily removes pips from your *health* dice. Taking 6 points of damage reduces your *health* dice by 1.

###  Dare Dice

Daring, focus, luck, chutzpah, fate, karma.

If you have time to focus before executing a task you may add your *dare* dice to your roll. Dare may also be added if do not have time to focus but, those dice are added to the Dungeon Master's Doom Pool. Temporary *dare* die are lost at the end of a session and whenever a *fumble* is rolled.

#### Dare checks

The **DM** may call for a *dare check* any time it is warranted by the story. Often, only a single success is required to pass a dare check and avoid some misfortune.

## Occupations

1. **Hunter, Ranger**   
+1d *Power*, +1d *agility*, a bow (+2d) & 12 arrows, *healing herbs* (6), dagger (+1d fast), combat skills

## Arcana skills
+2h for magic related tasks.

## Thief's skills
+2h for all rolls a thief may excel at. Concealable weapons confer +3d and ignore armor on surprise attacks.

### Poison
There are many kinds of poison but the rules for generic poison are as follows. Poisoned weapons cause the number of hits that do damage to a target to double. Poisoned weapons remain poisonous for a single combat encounter in which the weapon is used.

Applying poison to a weapon has a difficulty of 3. A thief would roll *agility* + 2h and likely add their *dare* as well. A failed check wastes the poison and causes 1d6 damage.

Drinking or eating poison requires 4 *health* hits. Failing inflicts 4d6hp.

Ammo is unlimited and ignored.

#### Optional ammo rules

Ammunition is an item like any other. Each gear slot of ammo contains a multiple of 6 shots. You can use d6s to track ammo.

# Armor

Armor reduces **agility** Dice and incoming damage. If **agility** is at minimum, **power** is reduced instead.

* Scrap armor -1 damage, -2 **Agility**
* Light armor -1 damage, -1 **Agility**
* Heavy armor -2 damage, -3 **Agility**
* Shield -1 damage, -1 **Agility**

## Shields
Your shield may be destroyed to block a critical hit and easily dropped to commit an action using *agility*.

# Combat
## Basic Combat Sequence

1. *Agility* dice determine turn order. Place a die in front of you set to the number of *Agility* dice your character currently has. This is your *speed*. If your number of *agility* dice changes, change the *speed* die. Other factors, such as weapon choice, may modify your turn order.
1. Count up from one to six. At each number, Players and NPCs at that speed declare their actions.
1. Count down from six to one. At each number resolve any ranged attacks and *quick* melee attacks.
1. Count down from six to one. At each number resolve any melee attacks and *slow* ranged attacks.
1. Count down from six to one. At each number resolve any move or move and attack and any *slow* melee attacks without movement.
1. Count down from six to one. At each number resolve any spells and any *slow melee* attacks with movement.

## Attacking
Attacking a target is a challenge roll like any other. Roll as many dice as you can. This is usually **Power** dice + Weapon dice.

Some skills, such as *combat* add extra *hits* to your roll.

Each die that comes up above the target number (usually 3) is counted as a **hit** and subtracted from the target's **health pips**. Armor allows a target to avoid a certain number of **hits** but **hits** that were the result of a roll of **6** are not effected by armor. 

NPCs and monsters do not make attack rolls. Rather, players roll for defense when monsters attack.

## Defending

Players roll their *agility* to defend. The player's *hits* are subtracted from the monster's attack. The remainder are subtracted from the players *health pips*. 

PCs and NPCs that are reduced to 0 *health pips* are *defeated*.

Armor has the effect of making some of a Player's agility into automatic successes. These dice cannot be used for agility related actions while armor is worn. A player wearing leather armor with 3 *agility* dice would only roll 2 dice as and add a single success to the result. If they try to jump over a pit wearing their armor, they only roll two dice.

## Disengaging

Moving away from an opponent that is in active melee combat with you incurs a free attack.

## Alternate Combat Actions

- Distract - If you are not the main target, attack and remove *hits* - target's *intelligence* from their next attack roll in this round.
- Disarm - Roll your *agility* against the target's *power* to cause them to drop their weapon.
- Trip - Roll your *power* against the target's *power* + *size*.
- Parry - Use *power* instead of *agility* to defend against the next attack this targets makes.
- Push - Use *power* - target's *size* to beat target's *agility* and knock back 5' + *hits*
- Grapple - use agility to get passed defense and ignore armor. Affected by reach of the defender's weapon. After success use power to defeat.
- Disengage - Use *agility* to beat target's *agility* to move away without incurring an attack. Failure means you can still move away but you incur an attack no matter what.

## Critical Hits

If double 6s are rolled, you will also roll on the critical hit table for that weapon. If three 6s are rolled, roll 1d6+6 on the critical hit table. Additional 6s add a +1 each to the roll.

Normal NPCs only roll 1d6 on their crit table or for their weapon type.

Players may choose to dodge a crit at the cost of 1 **agility** die. Crits that would appear to be mitigated by armor may be avoided at the cost of 1 armor level of armor protection. Heavy armor would be reduced to light armor and light armor would be ineffective until the armor is repaired. If the armor is removed and carried, the armor's negative effect on **agility** is eliminated.

The effect of rolling double 6s on challenges other than combat are at the judges discretion.

## Fumbles
If more than 50% of the dice rolled come up 1, it is a fumble.

### Player Character Fumble Table

Character fumbles on attacks are specific to the character. They following table may be used as a guide.

1. Fall on your sword. Roll *power* against yourself.
1. 
1. 
1. 
1. 
1. Trip into your opponent. If the attack has any hits, +2 hits. You are prone.

# Damage and Death

Damage suffered is subtracted from *Health Pips*.
Each time the last pip of a die is lost, the character must roll on the *Table of Terrible Injuries*.
For example; a character with 2 *health dice* will roll on the table when they lose their 7th *health pip* and their last *health pip*.

## Tables of Terrible Injuries

### 1+hp Injuries

1.
1. 
1. 
1.

1. Major artery. Die next round unless first aid is received.
1. Bleeding out.
1. Internal injuries.

## Healing

**Health** and other attribute Point damage heals between episodes and many scenes. Narrative damage from some crits, environmental effects, or strong monsters lasts longer. It may be permanent or require a long rest, or a quest to heal.

# Movement and Range

Distance is divided into 4 bands. *Close*, *Near*, *Far*, and *Very Far*. The actual size of the ranges expands as they move out. It is always possible to move from *Near* to *Close* on your turn but other distances are up to your DM.

# Size

Size is also measured in dice.

* 1pip - Tiny (bird)
* 1d - Small (gnome): +1d *agility*, -1d *power*; Inventory: 6+*health*; Can use of *agility* dice to attack but then cannot use it for defense this turn.
* 2d - Normal (human): +1d *health*; inventory: 10+*health*. The word **
* 3d - Big (Andre): +2d *health*, -1d *agility*; inventory: 14+*health*
* 5d - Giant (tree)
* 12d - Massive (building)

# Magic
## Spells

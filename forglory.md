## Introduction

<div markdown="1" class="colstwo">
<div markdown="1" class="keeptogether">
Pierce your nipples.
This game was created to allow players to make **zombie ninjas**, **axe witches**, **necrodroids** or whatever craziness they can think of.
The dungeon master can be riffing on the players actions and using random tables to create emergent stories.

This game simulates a piece of fiction rather than reality.
In this story a bow and arrow may be a better weapon than a gun.
The game using a variety of random tables as seeds for fun at the table and players and GM are expected to make up some table entries to suit the character and world.

Characters attributes are measured in the number of dice they roll.
If your character has a *Power* of 3, they roll 3 dice. Every die that rolls greater than 3, is a *hit*.

## Mechanics

<div markdown="1" class="colstwo">
When a character wants to do something and the success or failure will have a significant effect on the story, the player rolls a bunch of six-sided dice. Each die that *beats* the **Target number** of 3 is a **hit**. Any attempted task may require one or more **hits** in order to complete successfully.

Instant challenges, like jumping over a hole, require the **hits** be completed in a single roll. Cumulative challenges, like breaking down a door or defeating a *fire vole*, may be completed with cumulative **hits**. Even if a challenge allows cumulative **hits**, it may be beneficial to complete the challenge in a single action. Such as smashing through a door with a single blow to surprise an enemy.

### Chance of success table

This table shows the chance to achieve a certain amount of hits with differing amounts of dice.

| d6 | 0 hits | 1+ | 2+ | 3+ | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ |
|----|--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1  | 50     | 50 | 8  | 1  |    |    |    |    |
| 2  | 25     | 75 | 33 | 9  | 2  |    |    |    |
| 3  | 12     | 87 | 56 | 25 | 8  | 2  |    |    |
| 4  | 6      | 94 | 73 | 43 | 20 | 7  | 2  |    |
| 5  | 3      | 97 | 84 | 60 | 34 | 16 | 6  | 2  |
| 6  | 2      | 98 | 90 | 73 | 49 | 28 | 13 | 5  |
| 7  | 1      | 99 | 95 | 83 | 63 | 41 | 22 | 11 |

### Dice

Dice are the main unit of measure in the game. Character attributes are measured in dice and you can gain or lose dice from your attributes. Dice may be broken down into 6 pips. You may also gain or lose pips but it has no mechanical effect unless you gain or lose 6 pips. The notation '2d' indicates 2 six-sided dice. 2p indicates 2 pips. 

A character may have a *Power* of 3d and a sword which adds +2d for their attack. This would make an attack roll of 5d. Each hit on that roll will remove a 1 pip (1hp) of health from the target.

#### Terms

- 1hd: one *health* die.
- hit: a roll of 4,5, or 6.
- +1h: add one *hit* to your roll.
- +1d: add an extra die to your roll.
- 1p: one pip (pips are the dots on a 6-sided die)
- 1hp: one *health* pip.
- 3d6 +1d +2h: Roll  4 dice and add 2 *hits* to the result.

#### Ways to roll your dice

- 1d: Roll 1 die, a roll of 4-6 is a *hit*.
- d6: Use the face value of the die.
- d2: Roll a die and divide the face value by 2 rounded up.
- d3 - Roll a die and divide the face value by 2 rounded up.
- d12 - Roll 1d2. On a 1, roll 1d6. On a 2, roll 1d6+6.
- d18 - Roll 1d3. On a 1, roll  1d6. On a 2, roll 1d6+6. On a 3, roll 1d6+12.
- d33 - Roll 1d3 twice. The first die is the 10s place and the second is 1s. Rolling a 3 and a 4 makes 22.
- d36 - 
- d66 - Roll a die for the 10s place and then roll a die for the 1s place. Rolling a 3 and a 4 make 34.

<div markdown="1" class="keeptogether">
### Stunts

Stunts are the way you describe the actions your character takes. There are three levels of stunts and each one adds another die to your roll. Level 1 stunts simply describe your action in a cool way. Level two stunts incorporate the story, the environment, or one of the character's doom. Level 3 stunts are determined by the judge at the time.

- *I attack with my sword*. 0 dice.
- *I slash at the monster's neck*. +1 die.
- *I fling some of the swamp muck into the creatures eyes before driving my sword in*. +2 dice.
- Something so cool that it belies an example. +3 dice.

Co-operative stunts are when you include another PC in your stunt. The included PC may loan the player dice of the appropriate attribute for this action. They cannot use those dice on their next turn.
### The Doom Pool
Doom dice. Gm gains doom dice from player risk wager loan. Doom dice can be added to gm rolls or rolled to allow the gm to finish the scene.

## Characters

<div markdown="1" class="colstwo">

1. Choose one of your attributes to get an extra die and give the remainder of the attributes one die.
1. Choose or roll an occupation.
1. Choose or roll a piece of equipment.

### Attributes

Attributes are measured with dice.
The number of dice you have in an attribute is how many dice you roll in a challenge that uses that attribute.
The default amount, for a healthy character, in all 5 attributes is 1 die.
Each die has 6 pips.
Sometimes the pips are used as a unit of measure.

Attribute dice and pips maybe gained and lost during play.
Some attribute effects may take longer to heal or even be permanent if required within the narrative.

Losing or gaining pips has no mechanical effect until you lose or gain 6 pips. 
At which point you would roll one die more or less for contests which use that attribute.

Being reduced to zero pips in any attribute will have the effects described below.
In addition, for any contest that use an attribute that has been reduced to zero, you would use 2 dice and take the lower result.

If you have 0 pips in an attribute, you roll 2 dice in tests and take the lowest result.

#### Power Dice {: .item}

Attacking, lifting, pushing, breaking, and sometimes climbing.

#### Agility Dice {: .item}

Defending, running, jumping, sneaking, hiding, dodging, swinging, and sometimes climbing

#### Brain Dice {: .item}

Intelligence, wisdom, personality, disguises, discernment, perspicacity, spells, clues, psychic abilities, languages, codes, history.

#### Health Dice {: .item}

Health Points, stamina, fatigue, carrying, breath holding, disease resistance, poison resistance.

While the default *health* amount is 1 die, additional dice are awarded based on physical size. Humanoid sized characters, whether very small or very large, gain 1 additional *health* die. If you want to play a character so small or large that it should be reflected in the mechanics, you would instead gain 0 or 2 *health* dice. Smaller targets are harder to hit and larger targets are easier, as discussed in the *combat* section.

Damage from combat temporarily removes pips from your *health* dice.
Taking 6 points of damage reduces your *health* dice by 1 and requires a roll on a wound table.
Being reduced to 0 *health* dice means you are *exhausted*.
*Ehausted* characters move at half speed and use half their dice for any physical activity.

#### Dare Dice {: .item}

Daring, focus, luck, chutzpah, fate, karma.

If you have time to focus before executing a task you may add your *dare* dice to your roll. Dare may also be added if do not have time to focus but, those dice are added to the Dungeon Master's Doom Pool. Temporary *dare* die are lost at the end of a session and whenever a *fumble* is rolled.

##### Dare checks {: .item}

The **DM** may call for a *dare check* any time it is warranted by the story. Often, only a single success is required to pass a dare check and avoid some misfortune.

### Size


Size is also measured in dice.

* 1pip - Tiny (bird)
* 1d - Small (gnome): +1d *agility*, -1d *power*; Inventory: 6+*health*; Can use of *agility* dice to attack but then cannot use it for defense this turn.
* 2d - Normal (human): +1d *health*; inventory: 10+*health*. The word **
* 3d - Big (Andre): +2d *health*, -1d *agility*; inventory: 14+*health*
* 5d - Giant (tree)
* 12d - Massive (building)


### Occupations


1. **Hunter, Ranger**   
    +1d *Power*, +1d *agility*, a bow (+2d) & 12 arrows, *healing herbs* (6), dagger (+1d fast), combat skills
1. **Guard, Soldier, Tax Collector**  
    +2d *agility*, chain mail armor +2,  choose one extra from *equipment*, 10cp, sword (+2d), combat skills
1. **Executioner, Mercenary, Barbarian**  
    +1d *Power*, +1d *agility*, leather armor +1, black hood or furry, horned helm, sack, 10cp, battle axe (+2d+1h slow), combat skills
1. **Alchemist, Wizard**  
    +2d *brains*, *6 flash powder*, 1 alchemist spell, dagger (+1d fast), arcana skills
1. **Witch, Warlock, Midwife**  
    +1d *brains*, +1d *agility*, *6 healing herbs*, 2 witch spell, staff (+1d), arcana(S), forage(S)
1. **Thief, Rogue, Assassin**  
    +1d *Agility*, +1d *brains*, +1d *dare*, 4 Daggers (+1d, fast), lockpick, *poison* (6), Thief's skills

### Combat skills

+2h Combat related rolls. +1 Crit rolls. This character can divide up their attack dice between opponents.

### Arcana skills

+2h for magic related tasks.

### Thief's skills

+2h for all rolls a thief may excel at. Concealable weapons confer +3d and ignore armor on surprise attacks.
#### Cheater Die
Thieves get a *cheater die*. After rolling, a thief may elect to use their *cheater die* to enhance their roll. The thief simply declares their intention and then rolls 1d in secret. Typically, under a cup. They then tell the DM what number they rolled and these are added to their total hits. The dm has the option calling the thief's bluff. At which point, the thief must lift their cup and show the die to all. If the die is on a different result then that which was claimed, the thief has no *hits* for this roll and loses the *cheater die* for this session. If the thief was not bluffing, the DM empties their *doom pool* and the thief gets the option of rolling the *cheater die* again.

#### Poison

There are many kinds of poison but the rules for generic poison are as follows. Poisoned weapons cause the number of hits that do damage to a target to double. Poisoned weapons remain poisonous for a single combat encounter in which the weapon is used.

Applying poison to a weapon has a difficulty of 3. A thief would roll *agility* + 2h and likely add their *dare* as well. A failed check wastes the poison and causes 1d damage.

Drinking or eating poison requires 4 *health* hits. Failing inflicts 4d6hp.

</div><!--end section-->
<div markdown="1" class="section">
<div markdown="1" class="page">

## Combat

Combat takes place in rounds with each player and non-player character (NPC) usually taking a single turn in the round. Each round takes 10 seconds which can be tracked with dice by adding another die for each minute of combat. If you are tracking time closely, each combat encounter is rounded to the nearest 10 minute increment to account for catching your breath and patching yourself up after combat.

### Initiative

<div markdown="1" class="colstwo">

To determine who goes when, each player rolls an *agility check* the fastest monster's speed. Winners take their turns before the monsters and losers go after. There maybe other factors which affect the turn order such as minions typically going last.

### Attacking

Attacking a target is a challenge roll like any other. Roll as many dice as you can. This is usually **Power** dice + Weapon dice.

Some skills, such as *combat* add extra *hits* to your roll.

Each die that comes up above the target number (usually 3) is counted as a **hit** and subtracted from the target's **health pips**. Armor allows a target to avoid a certain number of **hits** but **hits** that were the result of a roll of **6** are not effected by armor. 

The number of dice rolled may be altered as described in the *Mechanics Overview* section. Additionally, the *dungeon master* may determine that aspects of the environment alter the number of dice rolled.

The relative size of the combatants effects the dice roll as well. Smaller targets are harder to hit and larger targets easier. Attacking a target one size larger adds two dice to the roll and is multiplied 
by two for each additional size difference. So a gnome attacks a giant with 4 extra dice.

NPCs and monsters do not make attack rolls. Rather, players roll for defense when monsters attack.

### Defending

Players roll their *agility* to defend. The player's *hits* are subtracted from the monster's attack. The remainder are subtracted from the players *health pips*. 

PCs and NPCs that are reduced to 0 *health pips* are *defeated*.

Armor has the effect of making some of a Player's agility into automatic successes. These dice cannot be used for agility related actions while armor is worn. A player wearing leather armor with 3 *agility* dice would only roll 2 dice as and add a single success to the result. If they try to jump over a pit wearing their armor, they only roll two dice.

### Disengaging

Moving away from an opponent that is in active melee combat with you incurs a free attack.

### Alternate Combat Actions

Distract
:   If you are not the main target, attack and remove *hits* - target's *intelligence* from their next attack roll in this round.

Disarm
:   Roll your *agility* against the target's *power* to cause them to drop their weapon.

- Trip - Roll your *power* against the target's *power* + *size*.
- Parry - Use *power* instead of *agility* to defend against the next attack this targets makes.
- Push - Use *power* - target's *size* to beat target's *agility* and knock back 5' + *hits*
- Grapple - use agility to get passed defense and ignore armor. Affected by reach of the defender's weapon. After success use power to defeat.
- Disengage - Use *agility* to beat target's *agility* to move away without incurring an attack. Failure means you can still move away but you incur an attack no matter what.

### Critical Hits

If double 6s are rolled, you will also roll on the critical hit table for that weapon. If three 6s are rolled, roll 1d6+6 on the critical hit table. Additional 6s add a +1 each to the roll.
Some npcs may have their own crit tables but, in general, NPCs do not crit.
The effect of rolling double 6s on challenges other than combat are at the judges discretion.
</div><!--end col -->

<div markdown="1" class="page">

### Fumbles

If more than 50% of the dice rolled come up 1, it is a fumble.

**One Shot:** 

#### Player Character Fumble Table

Character fumbles on attacks are specific to the character. They following table may be used as a guide.

1. Fall on your sword. Roll *power* against yourself.

1. 
1. 
1. Trip into your opponent. If the attack has any hits, +2 hits. You are prone.

## Suffering

<div markdown="1" class="colstwo">

### Healing

There are three types of damage that may be applied to attributes.
1. Normal damage that represents various types of wounds and heals at one pip per day.
Two pips for days only spent resting.
Field medicine, magical healing and potions all heal this type of damage and, usually, only *health* pips.
1. Momentary damage that heals after a few moments of rest. Such as when losing *health* pips to overexertion.
1. Permanent damage that does not heal normally and may require completing some great quest to recover.

### Death

Most combat damage suffered is subtracted from *Health Pips*.
Losing your last *health* pip does not mean you are dead.
Each time the last pip of a die is lost, the character must roll a their *health dice* on the *Table of Terrible Injuries*.
If they have no *health dice* left to roll, they must roll on the mortal injury table.
For example; a character with 2 *health dice* will roll on a table when they lose their 7th *health pip* and their last *health pip*.
Characters with no *health dice* must roll on the *Mortal Injuries* table every time they take any damage.
True death can only come as the result of a roll on the *Mortal Injuries* table and will trigger the character's *Death Throe*.
Additiotally, characters with no *health dice* are exausted and use only half their dice on any roll.

### Tables of Terrible Injuries (health dice)

## Space Time

<div markdown="1" class="colstwo">

For Glory is a simulator. It does not aim to simulate reality, but rather, a piece of adventure fiction.
Moments of in game time can be thought of in terms of scenes, and shots.
A scene is usually no longer than a single game session in real time but may encompass a smaller or larger amount in game time.
Scenes maybe connected by montages, scene setting shots, or simply, flow one to the next.

A player taking an action becomes the camera person and editor for that shot.
The patron may decide that an action is not possible but, if the player has a good understanding of the scene, they can do whatever they like.
The patron is decide how many *hits* are required and which attribute would use.
The player must say any applicable skills they have.
For any NPCs that are in the shot or nearby, the patron may decide that they have the opportunity to
react.
The patron must decide if the character would know that the NPC will get a reaction.
NPCs with a *power* or *agility* of 3 or greater usually get a reaction.

NPC reactions can work in one of three ways.
They may negate the possibility of the character completing their desired action.
This may require a roll from the player to avoid some negative effect.
They may add to the required number of *hits* the player character is required roll to complete their action.

### Types of shots

- Montage
- Close up

### Range

Distance can be divided into 4 bands. 
*Close*, *Near*, *Far*, and *Very Far*.
The actual size of the ranges expands as they move out.
It is always possible to move between *Near* and *Close* on your turn but other distances are determined by the patron and based on the nature of the scene and shot.

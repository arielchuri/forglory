<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Pierce your nipples. This game was created to allow players to make
<strong>zombie ninjas</strong>, <strong>axe witches</strong>,
<strong>necrodroids</strong> or whatever craziness they can think of.
This game is not intended to have a predetermined story arc. Rather, the
patron creates a world with non-player characters that have their own
goals. The patron can be riffing on the players actions and using random
tables to create emergent stories.</p>
<p>This game simulates a piece of fiction rather than reality. In this
story a bow and arrow may be a better weapon than a gun.</p>
<p>Characters attributes are measured in the number of dice they roll.
If your character has a <em>Power</em> of 3, they roll 3 dice. The sum
of all the dice whose face shos a 1, a 2, or a 3 determines the amount
rolled. The player will have a greater than 50% chance of at least
getting a sum equal to the amount of dice rolled.</p>
<h2 id="dice">Dice</h2>
<p>Dice are the main unit of measure in the game. Character attributes
are measured in dice and you can gain or lose dice from your attributes.
Dice may be broken down into 6 pips. You may also gain or lose pips but
it has no mechanical effect unless you gain or lose 6 pips. The notation
‘2d’ indicates 2 six-sided dice. 2p indicates 2 pips.</p>
<p>A character may have a <em>Power</em> of 3d. The number of
<em>hits</em> is the sum of all the dice that come up 1, 2, or 3. Each
<em>hit</em> on that roll will remove a 1 pip (1hp) of health from the
target.</p>
<p>The numbers 4, 5, 6 are not counted. We call them square, cross, and
lines and they have other meanings depending on the context.</p>
<p>You may also pair any 3s with <em>lines</em> (6) to get bonus
effects. Some are generic effects based on the action. Some are effects
based on your weapon.</p>
<p>Pairs of <em>crosses</em> (5) cause negative effects. Pairs of
<em>squares</em> (4) may also have effects that may be neutral. Usually
denoting effects caused by the environment or changes to the narrative
or the attitudes of the NPCs.</p>
<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h2>
<p>The patron describes the terrible predicament the players face as
well as the environment. Details about the world left unsaid maybe
decided by the players. The players decide their character’s actions
and, usually, the results of the actions are decided by the patron in
discussion with the players.</p>
<p>Some actions are more dramatic and require the player to roll. The
player will describe the action their character will take. The patron
will tell the player which of their character’s attributes should be
used and wether it is an <em>instant</em> or <em>cumulative</em>
challenge. The patron may also impart information about how difficult
the challenge is depending on how much information the character could
glean.</p>
<p><em>Instant challenges,</em> such as leaping over a chasm, require
the player to make a single roll. <em>Cumulative challenges,</em> such
as hacking through a door, allow the player to make multiple rolls. Each
roll takes time and removes the rolled number of hinderance points from
the obstacle or target.</p>
<p>The player will roll the dice for their attibute plus any additional
dice they can muster and take the sum of all the 1s, 2s, and 3s in their
roll.</p>
<p>The player may add any of their Stamina or style dice to any roll.
Those dice cannot be used again until they have been recovered.</p>

<p>Episodes are usually completed in a single session. They may be a
complete story on their own or they may link to a larger dramatic arc
taking place over an entire season of 4-8 episodes. Episodes are made up
of scenes which usually take place at different locations.</p>
<p>Most scenes are a series of player turns which could be the
individual cuts of a film. The amount of in game time that the actions
take is based on the type of scene and the interpretation of the
patron.</p>

<p>An adventure written for For Glory RPG may have a table of events
that may happen in a scene or add to the generic tables below.</p>
<h4 id="chase-scenes">Chase Scenes</h4>
<p>The participants in a <em>chase scene</em> are divided into as few
groups as possible. Usually, hunters and quarry. Each group gets a die.
Chase scenes are similar to combat enounters. Characters fight and make
ability checks as they move down a line of discrete locations. If the
pursued characters make it to the end of the line, they have
escaped.</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Create a string of locations to start the chase. Use a line of
points to keep track of where the characters are along the course. Some
locations may have more than one point on the line. Example: tavern,
street, entrance to outdoor market, fruit carts, basket seller,
alleway.</li>
<li>Determine a few <em>obstacles</em> and <em>opportunities</em> at
some of the locations.</li>
<li>Everyone rolls <strong>agility</strong> and count successes.</li>
<li>Take the lowest outcome and reduce it to one. Reduce everyone else’s
outcome by the same amount. These are your <em>movement
actions</em>.</li>
<li>Take turns in initiative order (greatest <em>agility</em> pips goes
first?)</li>
<li>On your turn you may use your <em>movement actions</em> to move from
one location to another or take other actions.</li>
<li><em>Hazards</em> present some difficulty that may impede your
progress if not managed well. Examples include slippery areas, fences to
jump over, or a herd of cattle. The DM will describe the hazard and the
player may ask questions about the <em>hazard</em> and decide how they
will handle it. The DM will then assign a difficulty and which attribute
to use. In addition to the usual modifications a player may make to
their roll, a player may use additional <em>movement actions</em> as
dice on this roll. Success means the hazard is easily bypassed. Failure
means the loss of</li>
</ul>
<p>two types of hazards. hazards where not enough hits on a roll
indicates a bad outcome like slipping and falling.</p>
<p>Hazards where you need to make progress through an area that needs
work to get through. Such as thick foliage or a wall that must be hacked
through.</p>

<p>Chaining from Symbaroum.</p>
<p>Symbaroum has player characters make all of the rolls, such as
rolling to evade attacks, in addition with assuming the game will be run
without battle maps, instead using abstract zones.</p>
<p>To handle forcing saves on multiple enemies, such as with a use of
powerful enough fireball, they have it where the spell chains, the
caster making a attack against the first target in the blast, if they
fail they suffer the damage and they move onto the next enemy of their
choice, making the same attack again, until they either run out of valid
targets or fail a attack, at which the spell ends.</p>
<p>This means that you don’t need any precise measuring tools to judge
whether enemies are affected by a area-of-effect, and can simulate more
powerful casters (those with better chances of hitting more often than
not) having a larger area-of-effect, without the need to have
measurements of the blast radius or additional math.</p>
<h2 id="suffering">Suffering</h2>
<p>gain a wound (roll on table) every time you lose a health die and
from some critical hets. level of complication you gain from injury
depends on how many health die you have left. injuries may effect other

<p>Injuries are a form of <a href="dooms.md">doom</a>.</p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>From wounded to marked. The character will not be coming back to any
further sessions. How that plays out is up to the player. They could die

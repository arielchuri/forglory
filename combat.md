# Combat
## Combat Action
- Attack
- Evade: add to focus (or Brains?) to agility dice until next turn
- Focus: add you Dare dice to your rolls through you next turn's action. 
- Disengage: leave melee to escape or allow a ranged attack. 
- Pistol Whip: A melee attack that allows you to shoot a pistol while in melee. 

How does a bayonet effect the combat sequence? 

Disengage is an attack that allows you to move without drawing an opportunity attack. Also needed to use many ranged weapons while in melee. Can cause some damage and ignores armor.

Skills that offer bonuses under certain conditions such as quick thinker for surprise. From starport scum. 
Skills as auto success rather than increasing pool. Sniper will always hit.

## Area of Effect

Chaining from Symbaroum.

Symbaroum has player characters make all of the rolls, such as rolling to evade attacks, in addition with assuming the game will be run without battle maps, instead using abstract zones.

To handle forcing saves on multiple enemies, such as with a use of powerful enough fireball, they have it where the spell chains, the caster making a attack against the first target in the blast, if they fail they suffer the damage and they move onto the next enemy of their choice, making the same attack again, until they either run out of valid targets or fail a attack, at which the spell ends.

This means that you donâ€™t need any precise measuring tools to judge whether enemies are affected by a area-of-effect, and can simulate more powerful casters (those with better chances of hitting more often than not) having a larger area-of-effect, without the need to have measurements of the blast radius or additional math.

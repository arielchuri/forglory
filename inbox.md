- spells are roll for effect but magic users can defend with counter spell and there may be a roll on the phlogistan table.

> (e.g. dnd's attacks of opportunities. Essentially means fights are always a binary win or die, so it only works in systems where players are expected to win every fight)
The problem here isn't that fights are a binary, it's that the alternative to winning is almost always death. In too many games, the stakes are basically permanently cranked to 11.
One of the systems I am tinkering with addresses this problem directly. At the outset of any conflict, the GM lays out the "Stakes". By default, the Stakes can never include player death. For instance, in a bar brawl, the Stakes might be, "If you win, you toss the hooligans out and every cheers. If you lose, you take your lumps, get bruised up pretty bad, and you'll still be recovering when the Night Watch shows up to investigate the ruckus." The players can then request to "Raise the Stakes", increasing the reward for winning while simultaneously increasing the risk. At this point, the Stakes might be raised to include the possibility of player death.
A system like this immediately solves so many of the problems of combat. If the Stakes don't include all the enemies being killed, you don't have to come up with ridiculous and clunky rules for stun or subdual damage just to take prisoners. Similarly, you don't turn every simple fight into some brutal fight to the death.

Adrenaline gauge that charges up in battle.
getting shot or attacked in movies. more like a reflex save.
From wounded to marked. The  character will not be coming back to any further sessions. How that plays out is up to the player. They  could die right now, go out in a blaze of glory (+3d), or retire.

Each time you lose 1d of health, roll on the wound table. 
Don't have health ratings. Instead have payers select tags baded on the narrative. Deep cut, Exhausted, Concussion, Shock, etc. 
These become temporary dooms that the players can use to earn dice. 
I’ve fallen in love with Wonders & Wickedness and (to a lesser extent) its follow up, Marvels & Malisons. They’re system neutral, but could be used in MB easily.

gain a wound every time Toulouse a health die. level of complication you gain from injury depends on how many health die you have left. injuries may effect other stat dice.

# Boss Fights

Boss's may have a predetermined list of wounds. 

They have HP pools. No matter how much damage an attack inflicts on a pool, it can only effect a single pool.

When an HP pool is finished off, the list of wounds is rolled on.

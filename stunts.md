# Stunts

Stunts are the way you describe the actions your character takes. There are three levels of stunts and each one adds another die to your roll. Level 1 stunts simply describe your action in a cool way. Level two stunts incorporate the story, the environment, or one of the character's doom. Level 3 stunts are determined by the judge at the time.

- *I attack with my sword*. 0 dice.
- *I slash at the monster's neck*. +1 die.
- *I fling some of the swamp muck into the creatures eyes before driving my sword in*. +2 dice.
- Something so cool that it belies an example. +3 dice.

Co-operative stunts are when you include another PC in your stunt. The included PC may loan the player dice of the appropriate attribute for this action. They cannot use those dice on their next turn.

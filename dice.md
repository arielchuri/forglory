# Dice

Dice are the main unit of measure in the game.
Character attributes are measured in dice and you can gain or lose dice from your attributes.
    Dice may be broken down into 6 pips.
You may also gain or lose pips but it has no mechanical effect unless you gain or lose 6 pips.
The notation '2d' indicates 2 six-sided dice.
2p indicates 2 pips. 

A character may have a *Power* of 3d and a sword which adds +2d for their attack.
This would make an attack roll of 5d.
Each _hit_ on that roll will remove a 1 pip (1hp) of health from the target.

The number of _hits_ is the some of all the dice that come up 1, 2, or 3.

The numbers 4, 5, 6 are not counted. We call them square, cross, and lines and they have other meanings depending on the context.

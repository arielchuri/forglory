# Dice

Dice are the main unit of measure in the game. Character attributes are measured in dice and you can gain or lose dice from your attributes. Dice may be broken down into 6 pips. You may also gain or lose pips but it has no mechanical effect unless you gain or lose 6 pips. The notation '2d' indicates 2 six-sided dice. 2p indicates 2 pips. 

A character may have a *Power* of 3d and a sword which adds +2d for their attack. This would make an attack roll of 5d. Each hit on that roll will remove a 1 pip (1hp) of health from the target.

## Ways to roll your dice

- 1d: Roll 1 die, a roll of 4-6 is a *hit*.
- d6: Use the face value of the die.
- d2: Roll a die and divide the face value by 2 rounded up.
- d3 - Roll a die and divide the face value by 2 rounded up.
- d12 - Roll 1d2. On a 1, roll 1d6. On a 2, roll 1d6+6.
- d18 - Roll 1d3. On a 1, roll  1d6. On a 2, roll 1d6+6. On a 3, roll 1d6+12.
- d33 - Roll 1d3 twice. The first die is the 10s place and the second is 1s. Rolling a 3 and a 4 makes 22.

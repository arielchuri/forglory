# For Glory Beasts!

Roll one or two items from the following two lists to create creatures
like; **Burrowing Slime Women** or **Spitting Rat Monkeys.** There are
alternate names as well. Some items could provide only flavor while
others may be used, but not be part of the creatures proper name.
Additional names can be found in DCC RPG Appendix S.

The powers from the first table are applied to the base creatures on the
second table. *Acid Dogs* are easier to stat than *Pig Wolves.* You may
interpret the names so that *Magic*, *King*, *Zombie* and *Flower* could
become *Lich Orchid*. *Flying* or *Bird* and *Un-dead* could be *Flying*
*Skulls*.

    Giant flowers seem harmless enough until you find yourself in the
    middle of them. They open their scent sacks beckoning unsuspecting
    creatures for a taste. Those who succumb walk slowly towards the
    flower (half speed), pushing away in who would stop them. They dunk
    their head into the flower and hang their limply until dead (1d3
    Stamina/round). DC 15 Will save, victims may get another save if
    someone tries to help them or there was a distraction as they walk
    towards the flower.

    Flora are mindless and enjoy similar powers to un-dead but are
    susceptible to critical hits. Flora takes double damage from fire
    and half damage from piercing or bludgeoning attacks.

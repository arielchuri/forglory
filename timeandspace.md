Episodes are usually completed in a single session.
They may be a complete story on their own or they may link to a larger dramatic arc taking place over an entire season of 4-8 episodes.
Episodes are made up of scenes.

Most scenes are a series of turns in which each PC may take any action they wish. The amount of in game time that the actions take is based on the type of scene and the interpretation of the patron.

- Standard scenes.
  The party maybe talking among themselves, or to non-player characters. They may be interacting with or examining the environment. The amount of time taken is usualy of little consequence.
- Fight scenes
- Chase scenes
- Dramatic scenes
- Cut scenes are described to the party by the patron. They serve to fill in the story for the party. Many scenes may end with a cut scene.
- Montage scene

## Scenes

## Chase Scenes 

The participants in a *chase scene* are divided into as few groups as possible.
Usually, hunters and quarry.
Each group gets a die.
Chase scenes are similar to combat enounters.
Characters fight and make ability checks as they move down a line of discrete locations.
If the pursued characters make it to the end of the line, they have escaped.

- Create a string of locations to start the chase. Use a line of points to keep track of where the characters are along the course. Some locations may have more than one point on the line.
  Example: tavern, street, entrance to outdoor market, fruit carts, basket seller, alleway.
- Determine a few *obstacles* and *opportunities* at some of the locations.
- Everyone rolls **agility** and count successes.
- Take the lowest outcome and reduce it to one. Reduce everyone else's outcome by the same amount. These are your *movement actions*.
- Take turns in initiative order (greatest *agility* pips goes first?)
- On your turn you may use your *movement actions* to move from one location to another or take other actions.
- *Hazards* present some difficulty that may impede your progress if not managed well.
Examples include slippery areas, fences to jump over, or a herd of cattle.
The DM will describe the hazard and the player may ask questions about the *hazard* and decide how they will handle it. 
The DM will then assign a difficulty and which attribute to use.
In addition to the usual modifications a player may make to their roll, a player may use additional *movement actions* as dice on this roll.
Success means the hazard is easily bypassed. Failure means the loss of

two types of hazards. hazards where not enough hits on a roll indicates a bad outcome like slipping and falling.

Hazards where you need to make progress through an area that needs work to get through. Such as thick foliage or a wall that must be hacked through.


### saved
A *chase scene* is a series of short of scenes.
The *chase die* keeps track of the scenes.
It may start on any number but, on 7, the chase scene is over.
Usually, because the quarry escapes.

### Chase Rules, Quick Encounters, and Dramatic Tasks from SWADE

Possibly a series of ability checks that influence each other. Could have some push-your-luck, bluffing the DM, and use the DM's Doom Pool.

Move dice between speed and handling

### Opposed conflicts like chases

- Each turn you roll an opposed check.
- You can choose to not roll some of your dice and save them for later.
- Saved dice may be added to later rolls.
- Prey starts at 2 and chaser starts at 0.
- Gain and lose points on your checks.
- Circumstances and choices affect the rolls and outcomes .
- Prey gets to 10 or whatever the goal is, they escape. 
- Chaser gets the same number of points as the prey, they catch up.
- More points, and they get an action.

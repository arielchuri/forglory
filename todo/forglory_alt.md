## Chase Scenes

Chase scenes are similar to combat enounters.
Characters fight and make ability checks as they move down a line of discrete locations.
If the pursued characters make it to the end of the line, they have escaped.

- Create a string of locations to start the chase. Use a line of points to keep track of where the characters are along the course. Some locations may have more than one point on the line.
  Example: tavern, street, entrance to outdoor market, fruit carts, basket seller, alleway.
- Determine a few *obstacles* and *opportunities* at some of the locations.
- Everyone rolls **agility** and count successes.
- Take the lowest outcome and reduce it to one. Reduce everyone else's outcome by the same amount. These are your *movement actions*.
- Take turns in initiative order (greatest *agility* pips goes first?)
- On your turn you may use your *movement actions* to move from one location to another or take other actions.
- *Hazards* present some difficulty that may impede your progress if not managed well.
Examples include slippery areas, fences to jump over, or a herd of cattle.
The DM will describe the hazard and the player may ask questions about the *hazard* and decide how they will handle it. 
The DM will then assign a difficulty and which attribute to use.
In addition to the usual modifications a player may make to their roll, a player may use additional *movement actions* as dice on this roll.
Success means the hazard is easily bypassed. Failure means the loss of

two types of hazards. hazards where not enough hits on a roll indicates a bad outcome like slipping and falling.

Hazards where you need to make progress through an area that needs work to get through. Such as thick foliage or a wall that must be hacked through.

### Chase Rules, Quick Encounters, and Dramatic Tasks from SWADE

Possibly a series of ability checks that influence each other. Could have some push-your-luck, bluffing the DM, and use the DM's Doom Pool.

Move dice between speed and handling

### Opposed conflicts like chases

- Each turn you roll an opposed check.
- You can choose to not roll some of your dice and save them for later.
- Saved dice may be added to later rolls.
- Prey starts at 2 and chaser starts at 0.
- Gain and lose points on your checks.
- Circumstances and choices affect the rolls and outcomes .
- Prey gets to 10 or whatever the goal is, they escape. 
- Chaser gets the same number of points as the prey, they catch up.
- More points, and they get an action. 

### Adventure Task

### Environmental Hazards

### Interludes

## The Adrenalin Die
On the second round of combat put a d6 on the table with one its face. Add this amount to player rolls this round and turn the die up every round in which the players take actions directly affecting the enemy.  

## Status Effects

Shock Stun Charm Mind control Drunk Zombified

#### Cyclops Encounter Table
1. 
1.

1. Playful

## Combat Action
- Attack
- Evade: add to focus (or Brains?) to agility dice until next turn
- Focus: add you Dare dice to your rolls through you next turn's action. 
- Disengage: leave melee to escape or allow a ranged attack. 

How does a bayonet effect the combat sequence? 

Disengage is an attack that allows you to move without drawing an opportunity attack. Also needed to use many ranged weapons while in melee. Can cause some damage and ignores armor. 

### Shield your friend.

https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/mggg8z/big_book_of_60_reimagined_and_new_status_effects/
Skills that offer bonuses under certain conditions such as quick thinker for surprise. From starport scum. 
Skills as auto success rather than increasing pool. Sniper will always hit.

## Weapon tags
Here are the different tags I use for my own system:

Reach - melee, but longer than normal, allowing you to control a greater area
Quick - can attack multiple times per turn
Tricky - can be used for grappling/tripping/disarming/etc
Sweeping - can attack a swathe of enemies all at once
Dueling - can be used to deftly parry and riposte
Striking - packs a serious punch, can smash through defenses
Small - small enough to wield easily in your offhand
Heavy - heavy enough to require 2 hands unless you're exceptionally strong
Massive - requires 2 hands, no matter how strong you are

And here are some example weapons I've created with those tags:

Dagger - Quick, Small
Sword - Dueling
Longsword - Dueling, Reach, Heavy
Mace - Striking, Sweeping
Lance - Striking, Reach, Massive
Bullwhip - Tricky, Reach
Shortbow - Quick, Massive
Longbow - Striking, Massive
Pistol - Small
Submachine Gun - Quick, Sweeping

## hirelings
take red shirts with you. they can level up.

Each time you lose 1d of health, roll on the wound table. 
Don't have health ratings. Instead have payers select tags baded on the narrative. Deep cut, Exhausted, Concussion, Shock, etc. 

These become temporary dooms that the players can use to earn dice. 


I’ve fallen in love with Wonders & Wickedness and (to a lesser extent) its follow up, Marvels & Malisons. They’re system neutral, but could be used in MB easily.

gain a wound every time Toulouse a health die. level of complication you gain from injury depends on how many health die you have left. injuries may effect other stat dice.

> (e.g. dnd's attacks of opportunities. Essentially means fights are always a binary win or die, so it only works in systems where players are expected to win every fight)

The problem here isn't that fights are a binary, it's that the alternative to winning is almost always death. In too many games, the stakes are basically permanently cranked to 11.

One of the systems I am tinkering with addresses this problem directly. At the outset of any conflict, the GM lays out the "Stakes". By default, the Stakes can never include player death. For instance, in a bar brawl, the Stakes might be, "If you win, you toss the hooligans out and every cheers. If you lose, you take your lumps, get bruised up pretty bad, and you'll still be recovering when the Night Watch shows up to investigate the ruckus." The players can then request to "Raise the Stakes", increasing the reward for winning while simultaneously increasing the risk. At this point, the Stakes might be raised to include the possibility of player death.

A system like this immediately solves so many of the problems of combat. If the Stakes don't include all the enemies being killed, you don't have to come up with ridiculous and clunky rules for stun or subdual damage just to take prisoners. Similarly, you don't turn every simple fight into some brutal fight to the death.

## area of effect without maps
Chaining from Symbaroum.

Symbaroum has player characters make all of the rolls, such as rolling to evade attacks, in addition with assuming the game will be run without battle maps, instead using abstract zones.

To handle forcing saves on multiple enemies, such as with a use of powerful enough fireball, they have it where the spell chains, the caster making a attack against the first target in the blast, if they fail they suffer the damage and they move onto the next enemy of their choice, making the same attack again, until they either run out of valid targets or fail a attack, at which the spell ends.

This means that you don’t need any precise measuring tools to judge whether enemies are affected by a area-of-effect, and can simulate more powerful casters (those with better chances of hitting more often than not) having a larger area-of-effect, without the need to have measurements of the blast radius or additional math.

From wounded to marked. The  character will not be coming back to any further sessions. How that plays out is up to the player. They  could die right now, go out in a blaze of glory (+3d), or retire.
## Healing Herbs

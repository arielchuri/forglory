## Simple Test

The character attempts an action by rolling the appropriate dice.
Jumping a chasm may require Strength dice.
The patron assigns a Hinderance number to the action based on the external circumstances. 
The player will take the some of all the 1s, 2s, and 3s in their roll and try to meet that number. 

The player may add any of their Stamina dice but those dice cannot be used again until they have been recovered. 

In some cases, the die roll is subtracted from the Hindarence.
An example of this would be breaking down a door with an are.
